Answering Product -Questions by Utilizing Questions from Other Contextually Similar Products
abstract
Predicting the answer to a product-related question is an emerging field of research that recently attracted a lot of attention .
Answering subjective and opinion - based questions is most challenging due to the dependency on customer - generated content .
Previous works mostly focused on review- aware answer prediction ; however , these approaches fail for new or unpopular products , having no ( or only a few ) reviews at hand .
In this work , we propose a novel and complementary approach for predicting the answer for such questions , based on the answers for similar questions asked on similar products .
We measure the contextual similarity between products based on the answers they provide for the same question .
A mixture - of- expert framework is used to predict the answer by aggregating the answers from contextually similar products .
Empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms strong baselines on some segments of questions , namely those that have roughly ten or more similar resolved questions in the corpus .
We additionally publish two large-scale datasets 1 used in this work , one is of similar product question pairs , and the second is of product question - answer pairs .

Introduction Product-related Question Answering ( PQA ) is a popular and essential service provided by many e-commerce websites , letting consumers ask product related questions to be answered by other consumers based on their experience .
The large archive of accumulated resolved questions can be further utilized by customers to support their purchase journey and automatic product question answering tools ( e.g. Jeon et al . ( 2005 ) ; Cui et al. ( 2017 ) ; Carmel et al. ( 2018 ) ) .
However , there are many unanswered questions on these websites , either because a newly issued question has not attracted the community attention yet , or because of many other reasons ( Park et al. , 2015 ) .
This may frustrate ecommerce users , in particular when their purchase decision depends on the question 's answer .
Automatic PQA may assist the customers and the sellers by answering these unanswered questions , based on various diversified resources .
Previous PQA approaches leverage product specifications and description information ( Cui et al. , 2017 ; Lai et al. , 2018 ; Gao et al. , 2019 ) , as well as customer-reviews ( Yu et al. , 2012 ; McAuley and Yang , 2016 ; Yu and Lam , 2018 ; Das et al. , 2019 ; Fan et al. , 2019 ; Deng et al. , 2020 ) , for answering product related questions .
However , there are two notable shortcomings to these two approaches .
Product information can typically address questions about product features and functionality , but ca n't address complex and subjective questions such as opinion question ( Is it good for a 10 year old ? ) , advice-seeking question ( What is the color that best fit my pink dress ? ) , or unique usage questions ( Can I play Fifa 2018 on this laptop ? ) .
Customer-reviews , on the other hand , can partially address this kind of questions ( Wan and McAuley , 2016 ) , yet there are many products with few or no reviews available , either because they are new on the site or are less popular .
We propose a novel and complementary approach for answering product-related questions based on a large corpus of PQA .
Given an unanswered product question , we seek similar resolved questions 2 about similar products and leverage their existing answers to predict the answer for the customer 's question .
We call our method SimBA ( Similarity Based Answer Prediction ) .
For example , the answer for the question " Will these jeans shrink after a wash ? " , asked about a new pair of jeans on the website , may be predicted based on the answers for similar questions asked about other jeans that share properties such as fabric material , brand , or style .
An example is shown in Table 1 .
The main hypothesis we explore in this work is whether the answer to a product question can be predicted , based on the answers for similar questions about similar products , and how reliable this prediction is .
As our method relies on the existing PQA corpus , it addresses the two mentioned shortcomings of the previous approaches .
First , it can address a variety of product-related questions that are common in PQA , including subjective and usage questions .
Second , our method can provide answers to new or less popular products as it leverages an existing set of similar questions from other similar products .
A key element of our proposed method is a novel concept that we refer to as Contextual Product Similarity , which determines whether two products are similar in the context of a specific question .
For example , two smart- watches may be similar with regards to their texting capability but different with regards to sleep monitoring .
In Section 3 we formally define this concept and propose a prediction model for measuring contextual similarity between products , with respect to a given question .
Additionally , we describe an efficient method to train this model by leveraging an existing PQA corpus .
Another appealing property of SimBA is its ability to support the predicted answer by providing the list of highly similar questions upon which the answer was predicted , hence increasing users ' confidence and enhancing user engagement .
Our main contributions are : ( a ) A novel PQA method that overcomes several shortcomings of previous methods .
( b) A novel concept of Contextual Product Similarity and an effective way to automatically collect annotations to train this model .
( c ) Finally , publishing two large scale datasets , one is a question similarity data set and the second is a large-scale Amazon product questions and answers dataset , details are provided in Section 4 .
Empirical evaluation of our method demonstrates that it outperforms a strong baseline in some question segments , and that a hybrid model is effective in all the vast majority of the questions .
Product : Dickies Men's Jeans , 100 % Cotton .
Q : Will these shrink after a wash ?
Predicted answer : No Similar Product 1 : Eddie Bauer Men's Jeans , 100 % Cotton .
Q : Do these shrink when you wash and dry them ?
A : No Similar Product 2 : Timberland PRO Men's Jean , 99 % Cotton , 1 % Polyurethane .
Q : Was there any shrinkage after washing ?
A : No shrinkage Similar Product 3 : Levi's Men's Jeans , 98 % Cotton , 2 % Elastane .
Q : Do these shrink at all during washing / drying ?
A : They have not shrunk
Related Work Automatic aswering product related questions has become a permanent service provided by many ecommerce websites and services ( Cui et al. , 2017 ; Carmel et al. , 2018 ) .
Questions are typically answered based on product details from the catalog , existing Q&A 's on the site , and customer reviews .
Each of these resources , used for answer generation , has been studied extensively by the research community recently , probably due to the complexity of this task , the availability of appropriate datasets ( McAuley , 2016 ) , and the emergent increase in on - line shopping usage .
Lai et al. ( 2018 ) built a question answering system based on product facts and specifications .
They trained a question answering system by transfer learning from a large-scale Amazon dataset to the Home Depot domain .
Gao et al . ( 2019 ) generated an answer from product attributes and reviews using adversarial learning model which is composed of three components : a question - aware review representation module , a key -value attribute graph , and a seq2seq model for answer generation .
Yu et al . ( 2012 ) answered opinion questions by exploiting hierarchical organization of consumer reviews , where reviews were organized according to the product aspects .
The publication of Amazon datasets of reviews 3 and Q&As ( McAuley , 2016 ) , triggered a flood of studies on review - aware answer prediction and generation .
McAuley and Yang ( 2016 ) formulated the review based question answering task as a mixtureof-experts framework - each review is an " expert " that votes on the answer to a yes / no question .
Their model learns to identify ' relevant ' reviews based on those that vote correctly .
In a following work , Wan and McAuley ( 2016 ) observed that questions have multiple , often divergent , answers , and the full spectrum of answers should be further utilized to train the answering system .
Chen et al . ( 2019 ) described a multi-task attention mechanism which exploits large amounts of Q&As , and a few manually labeled reviews , for answer prediction .
Fan et al. ( 2019 ) proposed a neural architecture , directly fed by the raw text of the question and reviews , to mark review segment as the final answer , in a reading comprehension fashion .
Das et al. ( 2019 ) learned an adversarial network for inferring reviews which best answer a question , or augment a given answer .
Deng et al. ( 2020 ) incorporated opinion mining into the reviewbased answer generation .
Yu and Lam ( 2018 ) generated aspect-specific representation for questions and reviews for answer prediction for yes - no questions .
used transfer learning from a resource- rich source domain to a resource - poor target domain , by simultaneously learning shared representations of questions and reviews in a unified framework of both domains .
All this line of works assume the existence of rich set of product reviews to be used for question answering .
This solution fails when no reviews are available .
The challenge of review generation for a given product , while utilizing similar products ' reviews , was addressed by Park et al . ( 2015 ) .
For a given product they extracted useful sentences from the reviews of other similar products .
Similarly , ( Pourgholamali , 2016 ) mined relevant content for a product from various content resources available for similar products .
Both works focused on the extraction of general useful product related information rather than answering a specific product question , as in our case .
Second , the product-similarity methods they considered rely on product specifications and description , and do not depend on the question to be answered , while our method considers a specific question at hand when estimating contextual product similarity .
Similarity - Based Answer Prediction
In this section , we introduce the Similarity - Based Answer -prediction ( SimBA ) method for predicting the answer for a product question , based on the answers for other similar product questions .
We restrict our study to yes / no questions only , due to their popularity in the PQA domain ( 54 % on our PQA dataset ) , and following common practices in answer prediction studies ( McAuley and Yang , 2016 ; Yu and Lam , 2018 ) .
Figure 1 presents our prediction framework and its main components .
Formally , a question - product - answer tuple is denoted by r j = ( q j , p j , a j ) , where a j ?
{ yes , no }.
C = {r j } N j=1 is the set of N tuples of a given product category .
r t = ( q t , p t , ? ) 4 is the target record of an unanswered question q t , asked about product p t .
We treat C as the knowledgebase we use for answering q t .
Given a target record r t , in order to predict its answer a t , we first retrieve a set of records from C with the most similar questions to q t ( Figure 1 , stage 1 ) .
We denote the retrieved records as siblings of r t .
We then filter the siblings by applying a Question - to - Question similarity ( Q2Q ) model , keeping only records with highly similar questions which are expected to have the same question intent as of q t , ( Figure 1 , stage 2 ) .
We denote these records as twins of r t .
We then apply our Contextual Product Similarity ( CPS ) model to measure the contextual similarity between r t and its twins ( Figure 1 , stage 3 ) .
The CPS similarity score is used to weight the twins by considering them as voters , applying a mixture - of-experts model over their answers for the final answer prediction ( Figure 1 , stage 4 ) .
More details about the model 's components , the training processes , and other specifications , are described in the following .
Sibling Retrieval Given a target record r t , and a corpus of productquestion - answer records C , our first goal is to re -245 trieve all records with a question having the same intent as of q t .
As C might be very large , applying a complex neural model to measure the similarity of each question in C to q t is often infeasible .
We therefore apply a two step retrieval process .
In a preliminary offline step , we index the records in C by creating embedding vectors for their questions , using a pre-trained encoder .
For retrieval , done both during training and inference , we similarly embed the question q t into vector e t .
We then use a fast Approximate K Nearest Neighbors ( AKNN ) search to retrieve K records , with the most similar questions , based on the cosine similarity between e t and the embedding vectors of the questions in C .
We denote the set of retrieved siblings of r t by S ( r t ) .
Twin detection
The retrieved sibling records are those with the most similar questions to the target question .
In the second step of the retrieval process , we enhance our record selection by applying a highly accurate transformer - based Question - to - Question ( Q2Q ) classifier ( See Section 5.1 ) , which we train over our question to question similarity dataset ( Section 4.1 ) .
The Q2Q( q t , q k ) classifier predicts the similarity between a target question q t and each of the questions q k in S ( r t ) .
A record r k is considered a twin of r t if Q2Q ( q t , q k ) > ? , where 0.5 ? ? ? 1.0 is a hyper-parameter of the system .
We denote the set of twins of r t by T ( r t ) .
Contextual Product Similarity ( CPS )
We consider products p 1 and p 2 to be contextually similar , with respect to a yes / no question q , if the answer to q on both products is the same 5 .
Given a pair of twin records ( r 1 , r 2 ) , our CPS model is aims to predict the contextual similarity between them , i.e. whether their ( highly similar ) questions have the same answer .
Since r 1 and r 2 are twins , their questions are expected to have the same intent ; yet , they might be phrased differently .
To avoid losing any information , we provide both questions as input to the CPS model , during training and during inference time .
between a target record r t , and one of its twinsrecord r j .
For each record , the question - product pair is embedded using a pre-trained transformer encoder , allowing the product textual content and the question text attend each other 6 : H t = Encoder ( q t , p t ) , H j = Encoder( q j , p j )
The two models share weights to avoid over-fitting and for more efficient learning .
A second encoder embeds the textual content of both products , encapsulating the similarity between them : H tj = Encoder( p t , p j )
Then , a one hidden MLP layer takes the concatenation of the three embedding vectors , to predict the probability of a t = a j , ? tj = CP S( r t , r j ) = P ( a t =a j |r t , r j ) = M LP ( H t ? H j ?
H tj ) ( 1 ) Another key advantage of the CPS model is its ability to be trained on a large scale , without human annotations , by simply yielding the training labels directly from the polarity between the answers of twin pairs extracted from our training data .
For any pair of twins ( r i , r j ) : Table 2 : Examples from Amazon-PQSim Dataset .
Each example consists of a user-generated question pair and a human-annotated label for their similarity .
label ( r i , r j ) = similar , a i = a j different , a i = a j ( 2 )
Mixture of Experts
A mixture of experts is a widely - used method to combine the outputs of several classifiers by associating a weighted confidence score with each classifier ( Jacobs et al. , 1991 ) .
In our setting , experts are individual twins that lend support for or against a particular answer for a question .
Each twin is weighted by its contextual similarity to the target record r t , as predicted by the CPS model .
Given a target record r t , the weight of each of its twins , r j ?
T ( r t ) is determined by ?( r j ) = max (?
2 tj , w min ) where ? tj = CP S( r t , r j ) , and 0 ? w min ?
0.5 is a lower weight- limit ; a hyper-parameter that we tune on the development set .
7
The predicted class of a t is therefore derived by P red( a t |r t ) = sign ? ? r j ?T ( rt ) ?( r j ) ?( a j ) ? ? ( 3 ) where positive / negative P red indicates ' yes ' / ' no ' respectively , and ?( a ) = + 1 , a = ' yes ' ?1 , a = ' no ' .
Our methodology can be easily expanded to incorporate more answer predictors ( voters ) of different types into SimBA .
An example for such an expansion is described at Section 5.3 .
Datasets
We introduce two new datasets to experiment with our answer prediction approach : 1 ) The Amazon Product Question Similarity ( Amazon - PQSim ) dataset which is used to train our Q2Q model ; 2 ) The Amazon Product Question Answers ( Amazon - PQA ) dataset of product related Q&As , used for training the SimBA model .
Amazon-PQSim Dataset
We collected a first-of - a- kind question - to -question similarity dataset of product-question pairs from the Amazon website ( Amazon - PQSim .
See Table 2 for examples ) .
Unlike the Quora dataset of general question pairs 8 , product questions are asked in the context of a designated product page .
This makes them unique and different from questions asked in other domains .
For example , the question
Is it waterproof ? , when appears on the Fitbit Flyer detailed page , should implicitly be interpreted as Is Fitbit Flyer waterproof ?.
The following steps were taken for the data collection : ( a ) randomly sampling product -questions from the Amazon website .
( b ) filtering out some of these questions ( e.g. , non-English questions , for more details , see Appendix A ) .
( c ) For each of the remaining questions , we retrieved up to three candidate similar questions from the collection .
A question is paired with the original question if the Jaccard similarity among them is in the range of [ 0.3 , 0.5 ] .
We ignore highly similar questions ( > 0.5 ) since we do n't want nearly verbatim pairs in our dataset , as well as dissimilar pairs ( < 0.3 ) .
( d ) Finally we used the Appen crowd - sourcing platform 9 for manual annotation of question pairs similarity 10 .
Each question pair was labeled by at least three judges , and up to seven , until reaching agreement of 70 % or more .
The above steps resulted in a nearly balanced dataset ( 1.08 positive - negative ratio ) of more than 180K product question pairs with judges agreement of 70 % or more , and among them about 90 K question pairs have perfect judges agreement ( 1.14 positive -negative ratio ) .
Amazon-PQA Dataset
We collected a large corpus of product questions and answers from the Amazon website , similar to the popular Amazon Q&A dataset ( McAuley , 2016 ) .
Since our answer prediction method directly utilizes an existing corpus of resolved questions , we aim to collect all available questions per narrow sub-category instead of a sample of questions across broad categories by the popular Amazon Q&A dataset .
For example , instead of sampling from the broad Electronics category , we collect all questions under the narrower Monitors and Receivers categories .
Raw Data Extraction
We collected all product questions , with their answers , from 100 subcategories , available on the Amazon website in August 2020 .
Overall , 10 M questions were collected , with 20.7 M answers , on 1.5 M products .
For full statistics of the raw data , see Table 7 in Appendix A. Yes / No Question Classification
We followed ( He and Dai , 2011 ) for detecting Yes / No questions using simple heuristics .
See Appendix
A for details .
Yes / No Answer Labeling Questions are typically answered by free-text answers , posted independently by multiple users .
In order to convert these answers into a single yes / no answer , we first classified each answer into one of three classes : yes , no and maybe , and then used majority vote among the classified answers .
We used a pre-trained RoBERTa - based classifier , and trained the model on McAuley 's dataset ( McAuley , 2016 ) , taking only yes / no questions .
See Appendix
A for details .
Experiments
We experiment with eleven product categories covered by our Amazon - PQA dataset ( Section 4.2 ) , training a SimBA answer prediction model for each of the categories independently .
Next , we describe the data preparation steps for each of the SimBA components .
Data Preparation Sibling Retrieval Using AKNN
For each record r ?
C ( C is the category dataset ) , we use AKNN to retrieve the top -K similar siblings from C , while making sure that neither of them share the same product with r .
We collect training example pairs by coupling each record r with each of its siblings : D ( C ) = r i ?C {( r i , r j ) | r j ? S ( r i ) } .
For retrieval we use Universal Sentence Encoder ( USE ) ( Cer et al. , 2018 ) to embed each question q i into a 512 - length vector e i .
We use the Annoy 11 python library for the implementation of efficient AKNN retrieval .
In all experiments , for each record we retrieve the top -K ( K = 500 ) similar records , based on the cosine-similarity between the embedding vectors .
Twin Detection Using the Q2Q Model For each sibling pair ( r i , r j ) ? D ( C ) , we use our Q2Q model to score their question -similarity and keep only those with Q2Q ( q i , q j ) > ? to yield a collection of twin pairs , D ( C ) .
We use ? = 0.9 to ensure only highly similar question pairs .
For our Q2Q model , we apply a standard pretrained RoBERTa ( Liu et al. , 2019 ) classifier .
Specifically , we use Hugging - Face base - uncased pre-trained model 12 and fine- tune 13 it for the classification task on our Q2Q dataset 14 , while splitting the data into train , dev and test sets with 80 % - 10 % - 10 % partition , respectively .
For ? = 0.5 ( its minimal value ) the model achieves test accuracy of 83.2 % with a precision of 81.3 % and a recall of 87.7 % .
When setting the twin confidence level threshold to ? = 0.9 , the precision of the Q2Q model raises to 89.9 % with a recall of 69.5 % .
We compare the performance of the Q2Q similarity classifier with several unsupervised baselines , namely : ( a ) Jaccard similarity , ( b ) cosine similarity over USE embedding , and ( c ) cosine similarity over RoBERTa 15 embedding .
The results are summarized in Table 3 , showing that the Q2Q model significantly outperforms these baselines .
CPS Model Training
The CPS model predicts the contextual similarity between a pair of twin records .
In our experiments , the textual content of a product consists of the product title concatenated with the product bullet points , separated by semicolons .
The question text is the original query as appeared in the Amazon PQA - dataset .
For the encoding modules of the CPS model we use a standard pre-trained RoBERTa - based model as well , while using the [ SEP ] token for separating the two inputs to each encoder .
For training , twin pairs are labeled according to their contextual similarity using Equation 2 .
We train , fine-tune , and test , an independent CPS model for each category set C , using D ( C ) , D dev ( C ) , and D test ( C ) ( details of the data split described in Appendix A ) .
The training set D ( C ) is created as described in Section 5.1 .
D dev ( C ) and D test ( C ) , are created the same with one modification - rather than retrieving the siblings for a record from the dataset it belongs to , the siblings are retrieved from D ( C ) , for both D dev ( C ) , and D test ( C ) .
This represents a real-world scenario where existing products with their related questions are used as a corpus for predicting the answer to a question about a new product .
Each product with all related questions appear only in one of these sets .
Evaluation
We evaluate the CPS model by measuring the accuracy of its contextual similarity prediction over D test ( C ) .
The accuracy per category is presented in Table 4 .
The model achieves a relatively high accuracy with a macro average of 77.2 % over all categories , presenting a significant lift of 9.7 % over the majority decision baseline .
This is an encouraging result , considering the fact that the answers for many questions cannot be directly inferred from the product textual information .
We conjecture that the model is able to learn the affinity between different products , in the context of a given question , for predicting their contextual similarity .
For example , the two backpacks Ranvoo Laptop Backpack and Swiss Gear Bungee Backpack , were correctly classified by the CPS model as similar ( ? ? 0.5 ) in context of the question " Will this fit under a plane seat ? " , and classified as different ( ? < 0.5 ) in context of the question " Does it have a separate laptop sleeve ? " .
Answer Prediction Methods
We experiment with our SimBA model and with a few baselines over the test set of all categories .
The first one is Majority which returns the majority answer among all records in the category .
Other methods are described next .
SimBA Given a target record r t , SimBA scores each of its twins by the CPS model and predicts the answer for q t , using Equation 3 . w min was finetuned on the combined dev set of all categories and was set to 0.38 .
Question Similarity Only ( QSO )
We modify the SimBA model to ignore the CPS classification score when implementing the Mixture - of- Experts model ( Eq. 3 ) , by setting an equal weight of 1.0 to all twin votes : P red( a t |r t ) = sign r j ?T ( rt ) ?( a j ) .
Product Similarity Only ( PSO )
We modify the SimBA model by setting q t and q j to empty strings at the input of the CPS model , both during training and during inference , forcing it to rely on the products ' textual content alone .
The twin retrieval process remains untouched .
Answer Prediction Classifier ( APC )
We experiment with a direct prediction approach that only considers the product textual content and the question for answer prediction .
For each category C , we fine- tune a pre-trained RoBERTa - based classifier over all records r j ?
C , using q j and p j ( separated by the [ SEP ] token ) as input and ?( a j ) as the training label .
SimBA+APC
The experimental results show that different answer-prediction methods ( e.g. SimBA vs APC ) may be preferable for different product categories .
Therefore , we combine both methods , for achieving optimal results , by mixing the vote of APC with the twin votes , using the Mixture - of - Experts approach : P red( a t |r t ) = sign ?( r t ) ?(?
t ) + r j ?T ( rt ) ?( r j ) ?( a j ) where ?
t is the APC predicted answer , and ?( r t ) = ?
1 , ? 2 and ?
3 for | T ( r t ) | ? 10 , 10 < | T ( r t ) | < 50 and | T ( r t ) | ? 50 , respectively 16 . All ? values ( ? > 0 ) are fine-tuned on the development set for each category separately .
The values we used are detailed in Table 10 in Appendix A .
Answer Prediction Evaluation
The answer prediction accuracy results of all tested predictors , macro- averaged over D test ( C ) of all categories , are presented in Figure 3 .
We inspect the performance of the methods on different subsets of the test data , where each subset is determined by all records having at least x twins , x ? [ 0..130 ] .
The horizontal axis indicates the minimal number of twins in the subset and the percentage of the data each subset represents .
For example , the results at x = 0 represent the entire test set , while the results at x = 10 represents the subset of questions with at least 10 twins , account for 40.2 % of the test set .
The performance of Majority begins with 66 % ( the percent of ' yes ' questions in the entire population ) and drops for questions with many twins .
We 16
We also tried a few different splits on the development set hypothesize that " obvious " questions , for which the answer is the same across many products , are rarely asked hence have fewer twins .
In contrast , informative questions , for which the answer is varied across products , are frequently asked w.r.t. many products , hence have many twins .
Therefore we see a drop in accuracy of the Majority baseline as the number of twins grows .
The accuracy of QSO is significantly higher than the majority - vote baseline .
This demonstrates an interesting phenomena in the data of similar questions that tend to have the same answer over variety of products , typically of the same type .
A few examples are presented in Table 5 .
The QSO method successfully detects these groups of questions and predicts the majority answer for each such group .
We find that PSO method generally does n't improve over QSO .
This is somewhat surprising , as we expected that using product similarity information , such as brand , model , or key features , would increase the prediction accuracy .
This demonstrates the importance of question -context , as used in SimBA , in addition to the product information alone .
Moving to SimBA , we can see a large performance improvement over the QSO and PSO methods , which we attribute directly to the CPS model .
We also see consistent improvement in accuracy with the number of twins , likely due to the larger support the model has for predicting the answer .
The APC method , despite its relative simplicity , performs very well and greatly outperforms the majority - vote and the QSO and PSO baselines .
For the segment of questions with less than 10 twins , APC outperforms the SimBA method .
This segment represents roughly 60 % of the questions .
However , for the segment of questions with 60 or more twins , which accounts for 13.6 % of the questions , SimBA method consistently outperforms the inductive baseline by 1 - 2 % .
When inspecting the results by category , as shown in Table 6 , we can see that considering all questions with at least 1 twin , the APC method dominates in 7 out of the 11 categories , while for questions with at least 60 twins , SimBA method dominates in 6 out of the 11 categories .
Finally , we see that the two approaches compliment each other and can be effectively joined , as the SimBA + APC method outperforms both of them over all subsets .
Conclusions
We presented SimBA , a novel answer prediction approach in the PQA domain , which directly leverages similar questions answered with respect to other products .
Our empirical evaluation shows that on some segments of questions , namely those with roughly ten or more similar questions in the corpus , our method can outperform a strong inductive method that directly utilizes the question and the textual product content .
We further show that the two approaches are complementary and can be integrated to increase the overall answer prediction accuracy .
For future work , we plan to explore how SimBA can be extended and be applied beyond yes - no questions , e.g. , for questions with numerical answers or open-ended questions .
Another interesting research direction is combining additional voters to the Mixture - of - Experts model , such as a review - aware answer predictor or a product details - based predictor .
Additionally , our current evaluation considered a static view of the answered product-question corpus , we plan to explore temporal aspects of our method , for example , considering questions age or ignoring answers of obsolete products that might be irrelevant .
A Supplemental Material
A.1 Amazon-PQSim dataset
The Amazon- PQSim dataset includes question pairs , where all questions are published on Amazon website .
Each pairs has a corresponding label : 1 for similar , else 0 .
The labels were collected via Appen crowd sourcing service .
We took the following filtering steps ( step b in 4.1 ) for each question : ?
Removed any question with less than five words .
?
Removed any question with more than 15 words .
?
Removed any none-English questions .
?
Removed any question with multiple questionmarks ( may indicate multiple questions ) .
?
Removed questions with rare words ( any word which is not in the top 2000 most frequent words ) .
A.2 Amazon-PQA dataset
The Amazon - PQA dataset includes questions and their answers that are published on Amazon website , along with the public product information and category ( Amazon Browse Node name ) .
The data includes the following fields : ? ' question_id ' , ? ' asin_id ' , ? ' question_text ' , ? ' answer_text ' , ? ' bullet_points ' , ? ' product_description ' , ? ' brand_name ' , ? ' item_name ' ,
In addition , we augment this data with fields derived from our current work : ? ' is_yes-no_question ' , ? ' yes - no_answer ' ( yes , no , maybe ) , Yes / No Question Classification
We followed ( He and Dai , 2011 ) Next , to determine each question 's final yes / no answer , we first omitted answers classified as maybe .
When a question is answered by a verified seller , we considered it as most reliable and used it as the final label .
Otherwise we used the majority votes among the remaining answers .
In our experiments , we ignore questions with an equal number of yes and no answers .
Dataset Split Each item in our dataset is a ( product , question , answer ) triplet .
We split the labeled triplets into train ( 80 % ) , dev ( 10 % ) , and test ( 10 % ) sets for each category , relating to the number of products .
Each product with all related questions appear only in one of these sets .
The statistics for this dataset are given in Table 8 .

( 2 ) Siblings are filtered by the Q2Q model keeping only twins .
( 3 ) Twins are scored by the CPS model .
( 4 ) A Mixture of Experts model uses these votes to predict the answer .
Figure 2 : 2 Figure 2 : The Contextual Product Similarity ( CPS ) model .
The target question - product pair ( qt , pt ) and the twin questionproduct pair ( qj , pj ) are encoded using a transformer encoder , while the questions attend the product text .
The texts of both products are coupled and also encoded , allowing the two product text attend each other .
The three output vectors are then concatenated and classified using an MLP classifier .

The horizontal axis indicate the minimal number of twins and the percentages of test questions each subset represents .
Table 1 : 1 Answer prediction example based on similar questions asked about similar products .
The answer for all contextually - similar products is ' no ' therefore we predict the answer ' no ' for the target question .

for detecting Yes / No questions using simple heuristics , such as checking if the question starts with a Be verb( am , is , are , been , being , was , were ) , Modal verb ( can , could , shall , should , will , would , may , might ) or an Auxiliary verb ( do , did , does , have , had , has ) , and addition - ally ends with a question mark .
We tested the classifier on McAuley 's dataset ( McAuley , 2016 ) , identified yes / no questions with 98.4 % precision at 96.5 % recall , while considering McAuley as ground truth 17 . Yes / No Answer Labeling As described in Sec- tion A.2 , we used the McAuley dataset ( McAuley , 2016 ) to train a RoBERTa - based classifier , taking only yes / no questions .
For testing , we used 5 an- notator to annotate 583 question - answer pairs , ran - domly sampled from our raw data .
The model achieved 97 % and 88 % precision for the yes and no labels , respectively , and a recall of 65 % and 51 % on the entire test set 18 .

Table 10 : 10 ? 1 , ? 2 and ?
3 values used after fine-tuning on our development set ( Section 5.3 ) .
Larger ? values give more weight to the APC vote .
We consider questions similar if they have the same semantic intent .
For example , can I wash this ? ,
Is the product washable ? ,
Is it ok to clean it with water ?
are all considered as similar questions when asked in context of a similar product .
https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html
The answer for the target record is unknown .
By design , both products belong to the same product category C , which prevents comparing unrelated products .
For example , comparing an airhorn and a computer fan in the context of the question is it loud is therefore prevented .
The product textual content can be accumulated from several resources .
In our experiments , we restrict the product content to its title and bullet points .
We tried using the CPS raw score for all twins , i.e. wmin = 0 , however , using a fine-tuned minimal weight yielded better results .

As the questions are asked in context of a specific product , they are often written in an anaphoric form ( e.g . Is it waterproof ? ) .
To keep our dataset general , we instructed the judges to accept such questions as if they included the actual related product name .
For example , the pair
Is it waterproof ?
and Is this Fitbit waterproof ?
were labeled as similar .
