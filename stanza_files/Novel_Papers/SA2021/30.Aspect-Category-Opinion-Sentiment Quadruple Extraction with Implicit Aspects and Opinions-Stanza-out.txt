Aspect-Category -Opinion-Sentiment Quadruple Extraction with Implicit Aspects and Opinions
abstract
Product reviews contain a large number of implicit aspects and opinions .
However , most of the existing studies in aspect-based sentiment analysis ignored this problem .
In this work , we introduce a new task , named Aspect- Category - Opinion - Sentiment ( ACOS ) Quadruple Extraction , with the goal to extract all aspect-category - opinion - sentiment quadruples in a review sentence and provide full support for aspect- based sentiment analysis with implicit aspects and opinions .
We further construct two new datasets Restaurant - ACOS and Laptop - ACOS for this new task .
The former is an extension of the SemEval Restaurant dataset ; the latter is a brand new Laptop dataset with much larger size than the Se-mEval Laptop dataset .
Both contain the annotations of not only aspect-category - opinionsentiment quadruples but also implicit aspects and opinions .
We finally benchmark the task with four baseline systems .
Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the new task and its advantage in extracting and describing implicit aspects and implicit opinions in ABSA .
The two datasets and source code of four systems are publicly released at https : //github.com / NUSTM /ACOS .
Introduction
As a fine- grained sentiment analysis task , aspectbased sentiment analysis ( ABSA ) has received continuous attention .
Its core task is to extract the opinion target described by an entity and its aspect ( collectively referred to as aspect ) from product reviews , and identify the sentiment toward the aspect ( Liu , 2012 ) .
The standard aspect-based sentiment analysis task includes two basic subtasks : aspect extraction and aspect-based sentiment classification .
By integrating the two subtasks , one can identify an aspect-sentiment pair ( g , s ) , where g is an aspect term , and s is the sentiment polarity toward the aspect .
( Hu and Liu , 2004 ; Qiu et al. , 2011 ) pointed out that the correlation between the aspect term and the opinion term is helpful for better ABSA .
The following studies in this direction includes aspect-opinion co-extraction ( Wang et al. , 2016a
Yu et al. , 2018 ; Li et al. , 2018 ; Dai and Song , 2019 ) , aspect-opinion pair extraction ( Chen et al. , 2020a ; , and aspect-opinion - sentiment triple extraction ( Peng et al. , 2020 ; Wu et al. , 2020 ; Mao et al. , 2021 ) , etc .
However , most of the existing studies only considered the extraction of explicit aspects and opinions , while ignored the implicit ones .
In fact , product reviews contain a large amount of implicit aspects and opinions .
Table 1 summarizes the percentage of implicit aspects and opinions in the SemEval Restaurant dataset and our new Laptop dataset .
It can be seen that nearly 44 % of the review sentences contain implicit aspects or implicit opinions in the Laptop domain , and the percentage of sentences containing both implicit aspects and implicit opinions also exceeds 8 % .
Similar percentages can be observed in the Restaurant domain .
Although some studies have attempted to solve the implicit aspect problem ( Liu et al. , 2005 ; Poria et al. , 2014 ; Chen and Chen , 2016 ; Wan et al. , 2020 ) or the implicit opinion problem ( Lazhar and Guiyassa , 2016 ) from respective perspectives , there is still a lack of a unified framework that fully discusses and solves the implicit aspect and implicit opinion problems .
In this work , we introduce a new task named Aspect- Category - Opinion - Sentiment ( ACOS ) Quadruple Extraction , with the goal to extract all aspect-category - opinion - sentiment quadruples in a review sentence , and provide full support for aspect-level sentiment analysis with implicit aspects and opinions .
As shown in Figure 1 , in the review sentence " Looks nice and the surface is smooth , but certain apps take seconds to respond " , surface is an aspect , Design is its category , smooth is the opinion toward this aspect , and Positive is the corresponding sentiment .
The four elements are combined into an explicit quadruple surface - Design-smooth -Positive .
In addition to that , there are two other quadruples that need to be extracted : Null-Design-nice -Positive which contains an implicit aspect , and apps-Software - Null - Negative which contains an implicit opinion .
The new ACOS Quadruple Extraction task has the following two challenges : ?
In term of dataset , so far there was no available dataset that is fully annotated with aspectcategory -opinion - sentiment quadruples including all implicit aspects and opinions ; ?
In terms of modeling complexity , the task includes two extraction problems ( aspect extraction , opinion extraction ) and two classification problems ( category classification , sentiment classification ) .
It is challenging to effectively model the four subtasks together to construct quadruples containing implicit aspects and implicit opinions .
To address these issues , we further construct two new datasets , Restaurant - ACOS and Laptop - ACOS , for the new task .
The former is an extension of the existing SemEval Restaurant dataset , based on which we add the annotation of implicit aspects , implicit opinions , and the quadruples .
The latter is a brand new one collected from the Amazon Laptop domain .
It has twice size of the SemEval Loptop dataset , and is annotated with quadruples containing all explicit / implicit aspects and opinions .
We finally benchmark the task by establishing four baseline systems , Double-Propagation - ACOS , JET - ACOS , TAS - BERT - ACOS and Extract - Classify - ACOS , by adapting the representative approaches in aspect-opinion pair extraction , aspect-category -opinion triple extraction or aspect-opinion -sentiment triple extraction to ACOS Quadruple Extraction .
The experiments on the two ACOS datasets demonstrate the feasibility of the new ACOS Quadruple Extraction task and its effectiveness in extracting and describing implicit aspects and implicit opinions .
The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows : ?
We introduce a new task named Aspect-Category - Opinion - Sentiment Quadruple Extraction , to address the implicit aspects / opinions issues in ABSA ; ?
We construct two new datasets for the task , with ACOS quadruple annotations including implicit aspects / opinions ; ?
We benchmark the task with four baseline systems .
The experiments demonstrate the new task 's advantage in addressing the implicit aspect / opinion issues .
Task
We first define the four elements of the ACOS Quadruple Extraction task based on ( Liu , 2012 ) .
( Peng et al. , 2020 ; Mao et al. , 2021 ) provided good summaries of recent tasks and terminology in ABSA .
For simplicity , in this paper we use aspect , category , opinion and sentiment to denote aspect term , aspect category , opinion term and sentiment polarity , respectively .
They are defined as follows : ?
Aspect denotes an entity and its aspect indicating the opinion target , which is normally a word or phrase in the text ; ?
Category represents a unique predefined category for the aspect in a particular domain ; ?
Opinion refers the subjective statement on an aspect , which is normally a subjective word or phrase in the text ; ? Sentiment is the predefined semantic orientation ( e.g. , Positive , Negative , or Neutral ) toward the aspect .
Aspect- Category-Opinion-Sentiment ( ACOS ) Quadruple Extraction is then defined as a task to extract a set of aspect-category - opinion - sentiment quadruples described in a review sentence containing n words r= [ w 1 , . . . , w n ] : S ACOS = {. . . , a i -c j -o k -s l , . . .} , ( 1 ) where a i - c j -o k -s l denotes an aspect-categoryopinion - sentiment quadruple , a i is the extracted aspect , c j ?
C is its category , o k is the extracted opinion , and s l ?
{ Positive , Neutral , Negative } is its corresponding sentiment .
1 Note that a review sentence usually contains multiple aspects and opinions .
The ACOS Quadruple Extraction task does not only identify four elements , but also combine them into a set of valid quadruples , meanwhile considering implicit aspects / opinions .
As the implicit aspect / opinion is not explicitly expressed as a word or phrase , in case of implicit aspect we set a as NULL and use category c to describe the opinion target , and in case of implicit opinion we set o as NULL and use sentiment s to describe the semantic orientation .
Datasets
We construct two new datasets , Restaurant - ACOS and Laptop - ACOS , for the ACOS Quadruple Extraction task .
Source The Restaurant - ACOS dataset is constructed based on the SemEval 2016 Restaurant dataset ( Pontiki et al. , 2016 ) and its expansion datasets ( Fan et al. , 2019 ; . Laptop-ACOS is a brand new Laptop dataset collected from the Amazon platform at the years of 2017 and 2018 ( covering ten types of laptops under six brands such as ASUS , acer , Samsung , Lenovo , MBP , MSI and so on ) .
It contains 4,076 review sentences , much larger than the SemEval Laptop datasets .
Annotation
The SemEval 2016 Restaurant dataset ( Pontiki et al. , 2016 ) was annotated with explicit and implicit aspects , categories , and sentiment .
( Fan et al. , 2019 ; further added the opinion annotations .
We integrate their annotations to construct aspect-category -opinion - sentiment quadruples and further annotate the implicit opinions .
For Laptop - ACOS , we annotate the four elements and their corresponding quadruples all by ourselves .
We employ the aspect categories defined in the SemEval 2016 Laptop dataset .
Two PhD students familiar with aspect-based sentiment analysis are selected as annotators for independent annotation with the annotation tool introduced by ( Yang et al. , 2017a ) .
The strict quadruple matching F 1 score between two annotators is 75.86 % , which indicates a substantial agreement between two annotators ( Kim and Klinger , 2018 ) .
In case of disagreement , a third expert will be asked to make the final decision .
Statistics and Analysis
The basic statistics of the two datasets are reported in Table 2 .
The Restaurant - ACOS dataset contains 2286 sentences with 3658 quadruples , and the Laptop - ACOS dataset contains 4076 sentences with 5758 quadruples .
As we have mentioned , a large percentage of the quadruples contain implicit aspects or implicit opinions .
By comparing two datasets , it can be observed that Laptop - ACOS has higher percentage of implicit opinions than Restaurant - ACOS .
In Table 3 , we further compare our two ACOS datasets with the existing representative datasets
Methods
We benchmark the ACOS Quadruple Extraction task with four baseline systems , namely , Double-Propagation - ACOS , JET - ACOS , TAS - BERT - ACOS and Extract - Classify - ACOS , by adapting the representative approaches in aspectopinion pair extraction , aspect-category -opinion triple extraction or aspect-opinion -sentiment triple extraction to ACOS Quadruple Extraction .
Double-Propagation-ACOS Since Double Propagation ( DP ) is one of the representative rule- based methods for aspect-opinionsentiment triple extraction ( Qiu et al. , 2011 ) , we propose to adapt it to our ACOS quadruple extraction task by first extracting all the aspect-opinionsentiment triples , followed by assigning the aspect category for each extracted triple .
We name the adapted approach as Double-Propagation - ACOS .
Specifically , we first follow the DP algorithm to extract the aspect-opinion - sentiment triples , where we utilize the syntactic relations between aspects and opinions to iteratively extract them in each review , and rely on the sentiment lexicon to assign sentiments ( i.e. , Positive , Negative , and Neutral ) to aspects and opinions in a bootstrapping manner .
Second , to identify the aspect category of each extracted triple , we use the following strategy : if the aspect in the triple is in the training set , we take its most co-occurred aspect category as the final aspect category ; otherwise , we adopt the aspect category of the nearest aspect in the input review as the final aspect category .
Based on the two steps mentioned above , we can extract the ACOS quadruples in each review sentence .
JET-ACOS
As one of the state - of - the - art approaches for aspectopinion -sentiment triple extraction , JET introduced an end-to - end framework to this task , by combining the identification of aspects , their corresponding opinions , and their sentiment polarities with a position - aware tagging scheme 3 . Similar to Double -Propagation - ACOS , we adapt JET to our task by first extracting the triple with JET , followed by predicting the aspect category for each extracted triple .
Specifically , we first obtain the candidate aspectopinion -sentiment triples based on JET , and then design a BERT - based model to get the aspect category of the extracted triples .
Given the review sentence r , we first feed it to BERT to get the context - aware token representation H as follows : H = [ h [ CLS ] , h r , h [ SEP ] ] , ( 2 ) where h r = [ h 1 , . . . , h n ] is the output representation for r.
Next , given an extracted triple a-o-s , we can obtain the representation of the aspect and the opinion as u a = avg ( h a ) and u o = avg ( h o ) , where avg (h a ) and avg ( h o ) are the average vectors of words in the aspect h a and the opinion h o , respectively .
We then concatenate u a and u o , and feed it to a fully - connected layer with the Sigmoid function for each category c : y c = Sigmoid ( W c [ u a ; u o ] + b c ) .
( 3 ) Given a-o -s and c , y c = 1 indicates a valid quadruple , and y c = 0 indicates an invalid quadruple .
In the training stage , we adopt the standard binary cross-entropy loss for optimization .
In the inference stage , we combine the extracted aspectopinion -sentiment triples from JET and our predicted aspect categories to get all the quadruples from each review sentence .
TAS - BERT - ACOS TAS - BERT ( Wan et al. , 2020 ) is one of the state- ofthe - art method for aspect-category - sentiment triple extraction , which integrates aspect category - based sentiment classification and aspect extraction in a unified framework by attaching the aspect category and the sentiment polarity to the review sentence and using it as the input of BERT .
To adapt TAS - BERT to our ACOS extraction task , we propose to adopt the input transformation strategy in TAS - BERT to perform category -sentiment conditional aspect-opinion co-extraction , following by filtering out the invalid aspect-opinion pairs to form the final quadruples .
Specifically , given a review sentence r , an aspect category c ?
C , and a sentiment s ?
S , the input is constructed as follows : x = [ [ CLS ] , r , [ SEP ] , c , s , [ SEP ] ] , ( 4 ) We then feed x to BERT to get the context- aware token representation H : H = [ h [ CLS ] , h r , h [ SEP ] , h cs , h [ SEP ] ] , ( 5 ) where h r = [ h 1 , . . . , h n ] is the output representation for r , h cs is the output representation for the concatenation of c and s , and h [ CLS ] is used for category -sentiment verification .
We then perform aspect-opinion co-extraction over H by modeling it as a single sequence labeling task .
Specifically , we employ a modified Begin-Inside -Outside ( BIO ) tagging scheme , which consists of five tags : { BA , IA , BO , IO , O} , indicating the beginning and inside of the aspect , the beginning and inside of the opinion , and others .
We feed h r to a CRF layer to extract the aspects and opinions in r with respect to the input category c and sentiment s as follows : Y ao = [ y ao 1 , . . . , y ao n ] = CRF ( h 1 , . . . , h n ) ; ( 6 ) Next , we perform Cartesian Product on the extracted aspects and opinions to obtain a set of candidate aspect-category - opinion - sentiment quadruples :
On the basis of S ACOS , we average the vectors of tokens in the aspect and opinion , and then feed their concatenation [ u a ; u o ] to a quadruple filter : S ACOS = { a 1 -c 1 -o 1 -s 1 , ... , a | A| -c | C| -o | O| -s | S| } , ( ? | A| ? 1 ? ? 1 Candidate Opinions ? |?| ? ? ? ? 1 -? ? 1 -? 2 -? ? 1 ? 2 -? ? 2 -? 1 -? ? 2 ? Valid Aspect-Category-Opinion-Sentiment Quadruples ? ? 1 -o 1 ? 1 -o 2 ? 1 -o |?| ? |?| -o 1 ? |?| -o 2 ? |?| -o |?| y acos = Sigmoid ( W [ u a ; u o ] + b ) , ( 8 ) where y acos = 1 indicates a valid quadruple , and y acos = 0 indicates an invalid quadruple .
Extract-Classify-ACOS
Finally , we propose Extract - Classify -ACOS by adapting one of the representative aspect-opinion co-extraction system to our ACOS quadruple extraction task .
Specifically , the first step performs aspect-opinion co-extraction , and the second step predicts category -sentiment given the extracted aspect-opinion pairs .
As shown in Figure 2 , we first insert two [ CLS ] tokens at the beginning and the end of the review sentence r , and then feed the transformed input to BERT to obtain the context - aware token representations H as follows : H = [ h [ CLS ] , h r , h [ CLS ] ] , ( 9 ) Similar to the method in TAS - BERT - ACOS , the explicit aspect-opinion co-extraction is based on a CRF layer with the modified BIO tagging scheme .
We further apply two binary classification tasks on the [ CLS ] tokens to predict whether there is implicit aspect or implicit opinion .
Thus , we can obtain the potential aspect set S A , opinion set S O , and perform Cartesian Product on S A and S O to obtain a set of candidate aspect-opinion pairs : S AO = { a 1 -o 1 , ... , a | A| -o | O| }. ( 10 ) Next , we model the category -sentiment classification as a multiple multi-class classification problem .
Specifically , for each category c , we concatenate the average vectors of each aspect-opinion pair a-o , and feed them to a fully - connected layer with Softmax function as follows : s aoc = Softmax ( W aoc [ u a ; u o ] + b aoc ) , ( 11 ) where s aoc ?
{ Positive , Negative , Neutral , Invalid} denotes its sentiment given current a-o and c , or indicates an invalid quadruple .
Experiments
We evaluate the performance of four baselines systems on two ACOS quadruple datasets .
Experimental Settings and Evaluation Metrics In Extract- Classify - ACOS , we adopt BERT base ( Devlin et al. , 2018 )
In evaluation , a quadruple is viewed as correct if and only if the four elements as well as their combination are exactly the same as those in the gold quadruple .
On this basis , we calculate the Precision and Recall , and use F 1 score as the final evaluation metric for AOCS Quadruple Extraction .
Main Results
Table 5 reports the ACOS quadruple extraction performance of four different systems on the two datasets .
It can be seen that Double-Propagation - ACOS gets the lowest performance .
It is reasonable that only using rules is somehow difficult to identify multiple implicit elements and their complex combinations in reviews .
JET -ACOS and TAS - BERT - ACOS achieve comparable F 1 performance : the former is better on Restaurant - ACOS dataset and the latter is better on Laptop - ACOS .
Extract - Classify -ACOS achieves the best performance among four baseline systems .
It outperforms JET -ACOS by 5.60 percentage points on Restaurant - ACOS and outperforms TAS - BERT - ACOS by 8.49 percentage points on Laptop - ACOS , respectively .
The main advantage is that Extract - Classify - ACOS can achieve robustly higher recall score .
In comparison , JET - ACOS has higher or comparable precision score but its recall is much lower .
It is also worth noting that the F 1 score of Extract - Classify - ACOS on both datasets are not high ( 0.4461 and 0.3580 ) .
It is reasonable because the evaluation metric is based on exact matching and the ACOS Quadruple Extraction is a more complicated task than the traditional ABSA tasks .
Effectiveness of Modeling of Implicit Aspects / Opinions
As we have mentioned , a large percentage of review sentences contain implicit aspects / opinions .
Therefore , efficient modeling of implicit aspects / opinions is of great importance .
To investigate the ability of different systems in addressing the implicit aspects / opinion problem , in Table 6 we split the testing set into four subsets and observe the performance on different subsets : 1 ) EA & EO denotes the subset with explicit aspects and explicit opinions ; 2 ) IA & EO denotes the subset with implicit aspects and explicit opinions ; 3 ) EA & IO denotes the subset with explicit aspects and implicit opinions ; 4 ) IA & IO denotes the subset with both implicit aspects and implicit opinions .
Among four systems , Double-Propagation - ACOS and JET - ACOS can only address EA & EO , while TAS - BERT - ACOS and Extract - Classify - ACOS can support both implicit aspects and implicit opinions .
They show comparable ability in modeling the implicit aspects / opinions .
Extract - Classify -ACOS is better in case of IA & EO and EA & IO on Restaurant - ACOS , while TAS - BERT - ACOS is better in case of IA & EO and IA & IO on Laptop - ACOS .
But Extract - Classify -ACOS performs significantly better in case of EA & EO on two datasets .
We further compare the performance on differ -
We choose four different sentences according to whether the aspect / opinion is explicit or implicit , and observe the predictions obtained by different approaches .
It can be observed that : 1 ) RACL ( Chen and Qian , 2020 ) accurately extracts the AS pairs in case of EA & EO , but it does not support implicit aspects and it fails to make predictions in case of EA & IO on our testing sentence ; 2 ) SDRN ( Chen et al. , 2020a ) is only capable of aspect-opinion pair extraction in case of EA & EO ; 3 ) JET can only extract aspectopinion -sentiment triples in case of EA & EO ; 4 ) Although TAS - BERT ( Wan et al. , 2020 )
Related Work Aspect- based sentiment analysis ( ABSA ) has drawn wide attention during the last decade .
As a core task of ABSA , aspect- based sentiment classification ( ABSC ) which aims to detect the sentiment of a given aspect has been extensively studied in the literature ( Jiang et al. , 2011 ; Tang et al. , 2015 ; Wang et al. , 2016 b ; Tang et al. , 2016 ; Zhang et al. , 2016 ; Yang et al. , 2017 b ; Ma et al. , 2017 ; Zhang et al. , 2018 ; Wang et al. , , 2019
Xu et al. , 2019 ; Tang et al. , 2020 ; Chen et al. , 2020 b ) .
In recent years , on the basis of traditional ABSC , a series of expansion tasks have appeared in this field .
We divide these work into the following four categories : Aspect-Sentiment Pair Extraction .
It also can be viewed as joint aspect extraction and ABSC .
( Mitchell et al. , 2013 ) first explored the opendomain aspect-sentiment extraction task by designing a variety of conditional random fieldbased models based on traditional discrete features .
With the recent trend of deep learning , researchers have proposed various neural pipeline approaches Hu et al. , 2019 ) or joint learning approaches for this task
He et al. , 2019 ; Chen and Qian , 2020 ) . Aspect-Opinion Pair Extraction .
( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) first addressed the task in a pipeline manner .
( Chen et al. , 2020a ) proposed to extract aspectopinion pairs with a double - channel recurrent network while taking the correlation between aspects and opinions into consideration .
designed a span-based multi-task learning framework to extract aspect-opinion pairs jointly .
The work on aspect-opinion co-extraction ( Wang et al. , 2016a
Yu et al. , 2018 ) can be viewed as the first stage of aspect-opinion pair extraction .
Aspect-Opinion -Sentiment Triple Extraction .
Considering the relation between aspect and opinion , ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) designed a feature - based opinion summary system , which identifies explicit aspect , opinion and sentiment , and integrates them into review opinion summaries .
( Qiu et al. , 2011 ) further proposed a Double Propagation method to utilize the syntactic relations between aspects and opinions to iteratively extract the aspect-opinionsentiment triples .
More recently , ( Peng et al. , 2020 ) proposed a two -stage framework to first extract aspect-sentiment pairs and opinions separately , followed by matching them to obtain aspect-opinionsentiment triples .
further proposed an end-to- end position - aware tagging scheme to model the relations among aspect , opinion and sentiment .
( Wu et al. , 2020 ) proposed a Grid Tagging Scheme to address this problem .
( Mao et al. , 2021 ; Chen et al. , 2021 ) transformed the triple extraction task into multi-turn machine reading comprehension task and achieved state - of - the - art performances .
Aspect- Category -Sentiment Triple Extraction .
Previous two categories only focus on explicit aspect-based sentiment analysis , while ignoring the implicit aspects .
To address this issue , ( Liu et al. , 2005 ) designed rule- based method to find the corresponding implicit aspects through the opinion existing in the review sentence .
With the recent advances of pre-trained models , ( Wan et al. , 2020 ) proposed a BERT - based architecture to address this task in an end-to - end fashion .
Since the problem of implicit aspect and implicit opinion has not been systematically addressed in previous studies , in this work we introduce a new task for Aspect- Category - Opinion - Sentiment ( ACOS ) Quadruple Extraction with implicit aspects and opinions , construct two ACOS Quadruple datasets , and benchmark the task with four baseline systems .
7 Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper , we introduce a new task , Aspect-Category - Opinion -Sentiment ( ACOS ) Quadruple Extraction , aiming to systematically address the implicit aspect / opinion problem .
We construct two new datasets for this task , with ACOS annotations including implicit aspects and implicit opinions .
We finally benchmark the task with four baseline systems .
Experiments demonstrate the advantages of the new task in aspect-based sentiment analysis with implicit aspects / opinions .
The focus of this paper is the introduction of the new task and datasets .
The proposed four baseline systems are relatively simple and leave much room for further improvements .
We welcome future work proposing stronger models on this task .
We also welcome the usage of our datasets on the other ABSA tasks .

Restaurant 2014/2016 and Laptop 2014/2016 denote the SemEval 2014/2016 Restau - rant and Laptop datasets , respectively .
Restaurant 2014/2016 contains the annotations of aspect , cate - gory and sentiment .
It should be noted the category definitions in two datasets are different .
Laptop 2014 contains only the annotations of aspect and sentiment , while Laptop 2016 contains only the annotations of category and sentiment .
Restaurant - 2014 - AO and Restaurant - 2016 - AO are two aspect-opinion pair datasets proposed by ( Fan et al. , 2019 ) , based on Restaurant 2014 and 2016 , respectively .
They removed the sentences with implicit aspects and added the opinion an- notations .
( Xu et al. , 2020 ) further added senti- ment which was originally included in Resturant 2014/ 2016 to Restaurant - 2014/2016 - AO , and ob- tained two aspect-opinion -sentiment triple datasets : Restaurant - 2014 -AOS and Restaurant - 2016 -AOS .
For Restaurant - ACOS , we integrate the above annotations to construct ACOS quadruples .
But it should be noted that we keep the sentences with implicit aspects in Restaurant - 2016 , and further an- notate the implicit opinions .
As a result , the size ( including sentences , AO pairs and AOS triples ) of Restaurant - ACOS is about 1.6 times that of Restaurant - 2016 - AO and Restaurant - 2016 - AOS .
The new Laptop -ACOS has 4076 review sen- tences .
The numbers of annotations for aspect , category , opinion and sentiment are 4958 , 4992 , 5378 and 4958 , respectively .
By combining these elements , we construct 5035 AS pairs , 5726 AO pairs , 5731 AOS triples , 5227 ACS triples and 5758 ACOS quadruples , nearly twice the size of Restaurant - ACOS .

During training , we use the AdamW optimizer of BERT with weight decay fix .
The maximum length of the review sentence is set to 128 , covering all sentences in two datasets .
We set the batch size and learning rates in aspect opinion co-extraction and category - sentiment classification as [ 32 , 2e - 5 ] and [ 16 , 3e - 5 ] , respectively .
The dropout rate is set as 0.1 .
The batch size and learning rate in the category classification of JET - ACOS and the aspect-opinion pair filtering in TAS - BERT - ACOS are all set as [ 8 , 5e - 5 ] , other settings of these two modules are the same as Extract - Classify - ACOS .
We divide the original dataset into a training set , a validation set and a testing set according to Table 4 .

The result shows that the worst perfor - mance is obtained on EA & IO rather than IA & IO .
One possible reason is that the categories cor- responding to IA & IO are relatively regular than EA & IO , and is easier to predict .

supports aspect-category - sentiment triple extraction for either implicit aspect or implicit opinion , it fails to give accurate predictions in case of IA & EO and IA & IO on our testing sentences ; 5 ) As for the three ACOS baseline systems , JET - ACOS is only capable of ACOS quadruple extraction in case of EA & EO , and has a false prediction .
TAS - BERT -ACOS and Extract- Classify - ACOS support ACOS quadru-ple extraction in case of both implicit aspects and implicit opinions .
TAS - BERT - ACOS performs better than JET - ACOS but still fails in the case of IA & EO .
Extract - Classify -ACOS performs generally the best and produces more accurate predictions in all cases .
Similarly , the previous representative tasks in ABSA can also be denoted by the combination of the above elements , e.g. , aspect-sentiment ( AS ) pair extraction ( Mitchell et al. , 2013 ; , aspect-opinion ( AO ) pair extraction ( Chen et al. , 2020a ; , aspect-opinion -sentiment ( AOS ) triple extraction ( Peng et al. , 2020 ; Wu et al. , 2020 ; Mao et al. , 2021 ; Chen et al. , 2021 ) , aspectcategory -sentiment ( ACS ) triple extraction ( Wan et al. , 2020 ) , etc .
ACOS datasets are available for all subtasks in ABSA , including aspect-based sentiment classification , aspect-sentiment pair extraction , aspect-opinion pair extraction , aspect-opinionsentiment triple extraction , aspect- category - sentiment triple extraction , etc .
JET contains two variants , i.e. , JET t and JET o .
JET t aims to identify the aspects , the offset of their corresponding opinions , and their sentiment polarity ; whereas JET o aims to identify the opinions , the offset of their corresponding aspects , and their sentiment polarity .
We employ JET o to extract the aspect-opinion - sentiment triple , as it has been shown to obtain better performance than JET t .
