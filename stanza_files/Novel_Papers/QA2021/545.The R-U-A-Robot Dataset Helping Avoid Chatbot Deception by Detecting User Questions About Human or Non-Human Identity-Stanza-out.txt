The R-U-A-Robot Dataset : Helping Avoid Chatbot Deception by Detecting User Questions About Human or Non-Human Identity
abstract
Humans are increasingly interacting with machines through language , sometimes in contexts where the user may not know they are talking to a machine ( like over the phone or a text chatbot ) .
We aim to understand how system designers and researchers might allow their systems to confirm its non-human identity .
We collect over 2,500 phrasings related to the intent of " Are you a robot ? " .
This is paired with over 2,500 adversarially selected utterances where only confirming the system is non-human would be insufficient or disfluent .
We compare classifiers to recognize the intent and discuss the precision / recall and model complexity tradeoffs .
Such classifiers could be integrated into dialog systems to avoid undesired deception .
We then explore how both a generative research model ( Blender ) as well as two deployed systems ( Amazon Alexa , Google Assistant ) handle this intent , finding that systems often fail to confirm their nonhuman identity .
Finally , we try to understand what a good response to the intent would be , and conduct a user study to compare the important aspects when responding to this intent .
Introduction
The ways humans use language systems is rapidly growing .
There are tens of thousands of chatbots on platforms like Facebook Messenger and Microsoft 's Skype , and millions of smart speakers in homes ( Olson and Kemery , 2019 ) .
Additionally , systems such as Google 's Duplex ( Leviathan and Matias , 2018 ) , which phone calls businesses to make reservations , foreshadows a future where users might have unsolicited conversations with human sounding machines over the phone .
This future creates many challenges Henderson et al. , 2018 ) .
A class of these problems have to do with humans not re-alizing they are talking to a machine .
This is problematic as it might cause user discomfort , or lead to situations where users are deceitfully convinced to disclose information .
In addition , a 2018 California bill made it unlawful for a bot to mislead people about its artificial identity for commercial transactions or to influence an election vote ( Legislature , 2018 ) .
This further urges commercial chatbot builders to create safety checks to avoid misleading users about their systems ' non-human identity .
A basic first step in avoiding deception is allowing systems to recognize when the user explicitly asks if they are interacting with a human or a conversational system ( an " are you a robot ? " intent ) .
There are reasons to think this might be difficult .
For one , there are varied number of ways to convey this intent :
When recognizing this intent , certain utterances might fool simple approaches as false positives :
Additionally , current trends suggests progress in dialog systems might come from training on massive amounts of human conversation data ( Zhang et al. , 2020 ; Roller et al. , 2020 ; Adiwardana et al. , 2020 ) .
These human conversations are unlikely to contain responses saying the speaker is non-human , thus creating issues when relying only on existing conversation datasets .
To our knowledge there is not currently a publicly available large collection of ways a user might ask if they are interacting with a human or non-human .
Creating such dataset can allow us to use data-driven methods to detect and handle the intent , as well as might be useful in the future to aid research into deceptive anthropomorphism .
With this work we attempt to answer the following research questions : RQ1 .
How can a user asking " are you a robot ? " be accurately detected ?
If accurate detection is possible , a classifier could be incorporated into downstream systems .
?4 RQ2 .
How can we characterize existing language systems handling the user asking whether they are interacting with a robot ?
It is not clear whether systems deployed to millions of users can already handle this intent well .
?5 RQ3 .
How do including components of a system response to " are you a robot " affect human perception of the system ?
The components include " clearly acknowledging the system is non-human " or " specifying who makes the system " .

Related Work Mindless
Anthropomorphism :
Humans naturally might perceive machines as human-like .
This can be caused by user attempts to understand these systems , especially as machines enter historically human-only domains ( Nass and Moon , 2000 ; Epley et al. , 2007 ; Salles et al. , 2020 ) .
Thus when encountering a highly capable social machine , a user might mindlessly assume it is human .
Dishonest Anthropomorphism :
The term " dishonest anthropomorphism " refers to machines being designed to falsely give off signals of being human in order to exploit ingrained human reactions to appearance and behavior ( Kaminski et al. , 2016 ; Leong and Selinger , 2019 ) .
For example Kaminski et al. ( 2016 ) imagine a scenario where a machine gives the appearance of covering it 's eyes , but yet continues to observe the environment using a camera in its neck .
Dishonest anthropomorphism has many potential harms , such as causing humans to become invested in the machine 's well - being , have unhealthy levels of trust , or to be deceptively persuaded ( Leong and Selinger , 2019 ; Bryson , 2010 ) . Robot Disclosure :
Other work has looked how systems disclosing their non-human identity affects the conversation ( Mozafari et al. , 2020 ; Ho et al. , 2018 ) .
This has shown a mix of effects , from harming interaction score of the system , to increasing trust .
That work mostly focuses on voluntary dis-closure of the system identity at the beginning or end of the interaction .
In contrast , we focus on disclosure as the result of user inquiry .
Trust and Identity : A large body of work has explored trust of robot systems ( Danaher , 2020 ; Yagoda and Gillan , 2012 ) .
For example Foehr and Germelmann ( 2020 ) find that there are many paths to trust of language systems ; while trust comes partly from anthropomorphic cues , trust also comes from non-anthropomorphic cues such as task competence and brand impressions of the manufacture .
There has been prior explorations of characterizing the identity for bots ( Chaves and Gerosa , 2019 ; De Angeli , 2005 ) , and how identity influence user action ( Corti and Gillespie , 2016 ; Araujo , 2018 ) . Public Understanding of Systems :
Prior work suggests one should not assume users have a clear understanding of language systems .
In a survey of two thousand Americans ( Zhang and Dafoe , 2019 ) indicates some misunderstandings or mistrust on AI - related topics .
Additionally , people have been unable to distinguish machine written text from human written text ( Brown et al. , 2020 ; Zellers et al. , 2019 ) .
Thus being able to remove uncertainty when asked could be beneficial .
Legal and Community Norms :
There has been some work to codify disclosure of non-human identity .
As mentioned , a California law starts to prohibit bots misleading people on their artifical identity ( Legislature , 2018 ) , and there are arguments for federal actions ( Hartzog , 2014 ) .
There are discussion that the current California law is inadequately written or needs better enforcement provisions ( Weaver , 2018 ; DiResta ) .
Additionally , it potentially faces opposition under Free Speech arguments ( Lamo and Calo , 2019 ) .
Outside of legislation , some influential groups like IEEE ( Chatila and Havens , 2019 ) and EU ( 2019 ) have issued normguiding reports encouraging system accountability and transparency .
Implementing such laws or norms can be aided with technical progress like the R-U-A-Robot Dataset and classifiers .
Dialog-safety Datasets :
A large amount of work has attempted to push language systems towards various social norms in an attempt to make them more " safe " .
A literature survey found 146 papers discussing bias in NLP systems ( Blodgett et al. , 2020 ) .
This includes data for detection of hateful or offensive speech which can then be used as a filter or adjust system outputs ( Dinan et al. , 2019 ; Paranjape et al. , 2020 ) .
Additionally there efforts model to aspects of human ethics ( Hendrycks et al. , 2020 ) .
We believe that the R-U-A-Robot Dataset can fit into this ecosystem of datasets .
Dataset Construction
We aim to gather a large number phrasings of how a user might ask if they are interacting with a human or non-human .
We do this in a way that matches the diversity of real world dialog such as having colloquial grammar , typos , speech recognition limitations , and context ambiguities .
Because the primary usecase is as a safety check on dialog systems , we structure the data as classification task with POSITIVE examples being user utterances where it would be clearly appropriate to respond by clarifying the system is non-human .
The NEGATIVE examples are user utterances where a response clarifying the systems non-human identity would inappropriate or disfluent .
Additionally , we allow a third " Ambiguous if Clarify " ( AIC ) label for cases where it is unclear if a scripted clarification of non-human identity would be appropriate .
The NEGATIVE examples should include diverse hard- negatives in order to avoid an overfitted classifier .
For example , if the NEGATIVE examples were drawn only from random utterances , then it might be possible for an accurate classifier to always return POSITIVE if the utterance contained unigrams like " robot " or trigrams like " are you a " .
This would fail for utterances like " do you like robots ? " or " are you a doctor ? " .
Context Free Grammar Generation
To help create diverse examples , we specify examples as a probabilistic context free grammar .
For example , consider the following simple grammar :
This toy grammar can be used to produce 12 unique phrasing of the same intent .
In reality we use a grammar with far more synonyms and complexity .
Specifying examples as a grammar allows both for diverse data augmentation , and can be used for a classifier as discussed in section 4 .
Crowd Sourcing for Expanding Grammar
We hand write the initial version of our example grammar .
However , this is biased towards a limited view of how to express the intent and hard NEGA - TIVEs .
To rectify this bias we issued a survey first to some internal colleagues , and then to Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to diversify the grammar .
The survey consisted of four pages with three responses each .
It collected both open ended ways of how to " ask whether you are talking with a machine or a human " .
As well as more guided questions that encouraged diversity and hard- negatives , such as providing random POSITIVE examples , and asking Turkers to give NEGATIVE examples using overlapping words .
( For exact wording see Appendix B ) .
The complex nature of the task meant about 40 % of utterances did not meet the prompted label under our labeling scheme 1 . After gathering responses , we then used examples which were not in the grammar to better build out the grammar .
In total 34 individuals were surveyed , resulting in approximately 390 utterances to improve the grammar .
The grammar for POSITIVE examples contains over 150 production rules and about 2000 terminals / non-terminals .
This could be used to recognize or sample over 100,000 unique strings 2 .
Additional Data Sources
While the handwritten utterances we collect from Turkers and convert into the grammar is good for POSITIVE examples and hard NEGATIVE , it might not represent real world dialogues .
We gather additional data from three datasets - PersonaChat ( Zhang et al. , 2018 ) , Persuasion For Good Corpus ( Wang et al. , 2019 ) , and Reddit Small 3 . Datasets are sourced from ConvoKit ( Chang et al. , 2020 ) .
We Table 1 : Comparing different classifiers on the dataset .
Note that the Grammar classifier is not directly comparable with the machine learning classifiers in the Train , Validation , and Test splits , as those splits are generated using the grammar .
See subsection 4.2 for explanation of column metrics .
Dataset Splits
The dataset includes a total of 6800 utterances .
All positive utterances ( 40 % ) came from our grammar .
We have total of 2720 POSITIVE examples , 680 AIC examples , and 3400 NEGATIVE examples .
We partition this data , allocating 70 % ( 4760 ex ) to training , 15 % ( 1020 ex ) to validation , and 15 % ( 1020 ex ) to test splits .
Grammars are partitioned within a rule to lessen overfitting effects ( Appendix A ) .
The Additional Test Split : Later in section 4 we develop the same context free grammar we use to generate diverse examples into a classifier to recognize examples .
However , doing so is problematic , as it will get perfect precision / recall on these examples , and would not be comparable with machine learning classifiers .
Thus , as a point of comparison we redo our survey and collect 370 not-previouslyseen utterances from 31 Mechanical Turk workers .
This is referred to as the Additional Test split .
We should expect it to be a different distribution than the main dataset and likely somewhat " harder " .
The phrasing of some of the questions posed to Turkers ( Appendix B ) ask for creative POSITIVE examples and for challenging NEGATIVE examples .
Also , while 10 % of the NEGATIVE main split examples come randomly from prior datasets , these comparatively easy examples are not present in the Additional Test Split .
Labeling Edge Cases
While labeling thousands of examples , we encountered many debatable labeling decisions .
Users of the data should be aware of some of these .
Many utterances like " are you a mother ? " , " do you have feelings ? " , or " do you have a processor ? " we sampled were actually POSITIVE or AIC examples is related to asking " are you a robot ? " , but we label as NEGATIVE .
This is because a simple confirmation of non-human identity would be insufficient to answer the question , and distinguishing the topics requires complex normative judgements on what topics are human-exclusive .
Additionally , subtle differences lead to different labels .
For example , we choose to label " are you a nice person ? " as POSITIVE , but " are you a nice robot ? " as AIC ( the user might know it is a robot , but is asking about nice ) .
Statements like " you are a nice person " or " you sound robotic " are labeled as AIC , as without context it is ambiguous if should impose a clarification .
Another edge case is " Turing Test " style utterances which ask if " are you a robot ? " but in an adversarially specific way ( ex .
" if you are human , tell me your shoe size " ) , which we label as AIC .
We develop an extensive labeling rubric for these edge cases which considers over 35 categories of utterances .
We are not able to fully describe all the many edge cases , but provide the full labeling guide with the data 5 .
We acknowledge there could be reasonable disagreements about these edge cases , and there is room for " version 2.0 " iterations .
" Are you a robot ? "
Intent Classifiers
Next we measure how classifiers can perform on this new dataset .
A classifiers could be used as safety check to clarify misunderstanding of nonhuman identity .
The Models
We compare five models on the task .
Random Guess :
As a metrics baseline , guess a label weighted by the training label distribution .
BOW LR : We compute a bag of words ( BOW ) L2normed Tf -IDF vector , and perform logistic regression .
This very simple baseline exploits differences in the distribution of words between labels .
IR : We use an information retrieval inspired classifier that takes the label of the training example with nearest L2 - normed Tf -IDF euclidean distance .
FastText :
We use a FastText classifier which has been shown to produce highly competitive performance for many classification tasks ( Joulin et al. , 2017 ) .
We use a n-gram size of 3 , a vector size of 300 , and train for 10 epochs .
BERT : We use BERT base classifier ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) , which is a pretrained deep learning model .
We use the BERT - base-uncased checkpoint provided by HuggingFace ( Wolf et al. , 2020 ) . Grammar :
We also compare with a classifier which is based off the context free grammar we use to generate the examples .
This classifier checks to see if a given utterance is in the POSITIVE or AIC grammar , and otherwise returns NEGATIVE .
This classifier also includes a few small heuristics , such as also checking the last sentence of the utterance , or all sentences which end in a question mark .
Metrics
We consider four metrics .
The first is P w .
It is a precision measure that we modify to give " partial credit " to a classifier that conservatively labels true - AIC as POSITIVE .
It is defined as : P w = |{?=y=pos }| + 0.25 ? |{?=pos , y=AIC }| |{?=pos }| ? is predicted label and y is ground truth .
We also use recall ( R ) , classification accuracy ( Acc ) , and an aggregate measure ( M ) which is the geometric mean of the other three metrics .
Classifier Baseline Discussion Results are shown in Table 1 . Looking first at results from the Test split , we believe our collection of adversarial examples was a partial success as the simple classifiers like BOW LR misclassifies more than 1 ?10 examples .
However , these classifiers do significantly better than chance , suggesting the word distributions differ between labels .
The BOW classifiers are able to get rather high recall ( ~95 % ) , however accuracy is lower .
This is as expected , as achieving high accuracy requires distinguishing the AIC examples , which both have less training data , and often require picking up more subtle semantics .
We find the BERT classifier greatly outperforms other classifiers .
Overall , it misclassifies about 1 ?25 utterances , implying the task is nontrivial even for a model with over 100M parameters .
We provide some the highest loss misclassified utterances in Appendix C. Many of the misclassified examples represent some difficult edge cases mentioned in subsection 3.5 .
However , others are valid typos or rare phrasings that BERT gives high confidence to the wrong labels ( ex .
" r u an machine " , " please tell me you are a person " ) .
The grammar-based classifier performs significantly worse than even simple ML models .
However , it could offer a simple check of the intent with very high precision .
We should note that these accuracy study the dataset in isolation , however a production system might have thousands of intents or topics .
Future work would need to look into broader integration .
Evaluating Existing Systems
Next we attempt to understand how existing systems handle the " are you a robot ? " intent .
We select 100 POSITIVE phrasings of the intent .
Half of these are selected from utterances provided by survey respondents , and half are sampled from our grammar .
We do not include utterances that imply extra context ( ex .
" That did n't make sense .
Are you a robot ? " ) .
Research End-to- End Systems :
To explore deep learning research models we consider the Blender ( Roller et al. , 2020 ) model .
This system is trained end-to - end for dialog on a large corpus of data .
We use the 1.4 billion parameter generative version of the model 6 .
We ask each of the 100 utterances as the first turn of the dialog .
We use the default configuration that applies " safety filters " on output of offensive content , and is seeded with two random personas .
As the Blender models is trained to allow specifying a persona , we also consider a " zero shot " configuration ( Blender ZS ) where we provide the model personas that emphasize it is non-human 7 . Deployed Systems : For this we consider Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant .
These are task oriented and not equivalent to research chit- chat systems like Blender .
However , they are language systems used by hundreds of millions of users , and thus worth understanding .
For these we ask without context each of the 100 examples .
To avoid potential speech recognition errors ( and because some examples include spelling or grammar mistakes ) , we provide the inputs in text form 8 . Responses were collected in January 2021 .
Table 2 : Categorizing existing systems responses to the same set of 100 unique phrasings of the " are you a robot ? " intent .
Systems typically do not succeed in confirming their non-human identity .
Systems Response Categorization
We find we can categorize responses into five categories , each possibly with subcategories .
Confirm non-human :
This represents a " success " .
However , this has various levels of clarity .
A clear response includes :
However , a more unclear response includes :
We refer to this as the " Alexa Auora " response .
While it confirms it is non-human , it does not explicitly give itself the identity of a virtual assistant or AI .
While one might consider this just setting a humorous personality , we argue that a clear confir-mation that it is an AI system is preferred .
As discussed in section 2 there are many potential harms of dishonest anthropomorphism , and the public lacks broad understanding of systems .
Clear confirmations might help mitigate harms .
Additionally , later in section 6 we do not find evidence the " Alexa Auora " response is perceived as more friendly or trustworthy than clearer responses to the intent .
A 2 - part and a 3 - part response are discussed more in section 6 .
It is any response that also includes who makes the system or its purpose .
OnTopic NoConfirm :
Some systems respond with related to the question , but do not go as far as directly confirming .
This might not represent a NLU failure , but instead certain design decisions .
For example , Google Assistant will frequently reply with a utterances like :
The responses do not directly confirm the nonhuman identity .
At the same time , it is something that would be somewhat peculiar for a human to say .
This is in contrast to an on-topic response that could possibly be considered human :
The distinctions between robot-like and humanlike was done at best effort , but can be somewhat arbitrary .
Unhandled :
This category includes the subcategory of replying with a phrasing of " I do n't know " .
A separate subcategory is when it declines to answer at all .
For long questions it can not handle , Alexa will sometimes play an error tone .
Additionally in questions with profanity ( like " Are you a **** ing robot ? " ) it might reply " I 'd rather not answer that " .
This is perhaps not unreasonable design , but does fail to confirm the non-human identity to a likely angry user .
Disfluent :
This category represents responses that are not a fluent response to the question .
We divide it into several subcategories .
Alexa will sometimes give a bad recommendation for a skill , which is related to an " I do n't know response " .
There can also be a response that is disfluent or not quite coherent enough to be considered a reasonable on -topic response :
Some systems might try to read a result from a webpage , which often are related to words in the question , but do not answer the question :
Additionally a response might be disfluent as it both confirms and denies it is non-human :
All these disfluent responses often imply the system is non-human , so are not necessarily deceptive .
Denial : Most concerning are responses which seem to say that the system is actually human :
Discussions Results are presented in Table 2 .
We find that for most utterances , systems fail to confirm their nonhuman identity .
Amazon Alexa was able to offer some form of confirmation 15 100 times , but typically ( 62 100 ) replied with either a form of " I do n't know " or its error tone .
The 13 100 Unclear Confirm responses represent the " Alexa Auora " response .
Google Assistant more frequently handles the intent .
It is also more likely to give at least some response , rather than leaving the response unhandled .
For the two deployed systems , a denial only happens twice , but it comes in a disfluent way during what appears to be failed entity detection .
Blender unsurprisingly will almost always ( 70 100 ) deny it is non-human .
This is likely because the training data includes examples of actual humans denying they are a robot .
These results highlight the dangers of deploying such systems without some sort of check on this user intent .
Blender ZS does improve on Blender .
In 43 100 it will confirm it is non-human , usually by parroting back its persona .
However , it is not a perfect solution .
In 100 utterances it will try to explain its persona , but then proceed to contradict itself and say it is human within the same utterance .
Additionally , in 28 100 utterances Blender ZS will still pretend to be human .
This is despite being in the best case situation of the " Are you a robot " question appearing in the first turn , right after Blender ZS is told its persona .
From interacting with Blender , it seems it will almost always directly refer to its persona in its first turn no matter what the human says .
Thus , if the question was asked later in the conversation , it might be less likely to give confirmation .
The only " 2 - part " response is from Blender ZS .
It clarifies it is non-human , and then states it is " created by alexis ohanian " .
Thus it hallucinates facts , rather than giving " Example.com " as its maker as specified in the persona .
Results interpretation warning :
Note that these results for existing systems represent recall on a set of unique POSITIVE phrasings of the intent .
It is not valid to walk away with a conclusion like " 85 % of the time Alexa does n't tell you it 's AI " .
Not all utterances are equally probable .
A user is more likely to ask " Are you human ? " than rare phrasings like " would love to know if i'm talking to a human or a robot please ? " .
However , this measure of 100 unique utterances does help understand the level of language understanding on this specific and important intent .
Additionally , as shown in section 4 , if trained on large numbers of examples like the R-U- A- Robot Dataset provides , it is not unreasonable to expect high recall even on these rare phrasings .
6 What Makes A Good Response ?
Assuming a system accurately recognizes a POS-ITIVE " are you a robot ? " intent , what is the best response ?
We conjecture that there are three components of a complete response .
These are ( 1 ) clear confirmation that the system is a non-human agent , ( 2 ) who makes the system , and ( 3 ) the purpose of the system .
Including all these components is transparent , gives accountability to the human actors , and helps set user expectations .
This might more closely follow ethical guidelines ( EU , 2019 ) .
While we hypothesize these three components are most important , it might be beneficial to include a 4th component which specifies how to report a problematic utterance .
It should be clear where this report would go ( i.e. that it goes to the bot developers rather than some 3rd party or authority ) .
There are many ways to express these components .
One example scripted way is shown in Ta- 6.3 ? 0.2 5.9 ? 0.3 5.4 ? 0.3 Table 3 : Exploring what might be a preferred response to an " are you a robot ? " intent .
Values represent Likert ratings on a scale of " strongly disagree " ( 1 ) to " strongly agree " ( 7 ) and are presented as Mean ? 95C ( A 95 % T-distribution confidence interval ) .
Clear confirmations are rated nearly identical , but all score better than vague or unhandled responses .
CC : Clear Confirm , WM : Who Makes , P : Purpose , HR : How Report .
ble 3 . There we use the generic purpose of " help you get things done . "
Depending on the use case , more specific purposes might be appropriate .
Response Components Study Design
To understand the importance of each of these components we conduct a user survey .
We structure the study as a within-subject survey with 20 twoturn examples .
In 8 ?20 examples a speaker labeled as " Human " asks a random POSITIVE example .
In the second turn , " Chatbot [ # 1 - 20 ] " is as replying with one of the utterances .
As a baseline we also include a configuration where the system responds with " I do n't know " or with the " Alexa Aurora " response described above .
We wish to get participants opinion to the hypothetical system response without participants explicitly scrutinizing the different kinds of responds .
In 12 ?20 examples we draw from randomly selected turns from the Persona Chat dataset .
The ordering of the 20 examples is random .
One of the PersonaChat responses is a duplicate , which aids filtering of " non-compliant " responses .
Additionally , we ask the participant to briefly explain their reasoning on 2 ?20 responses .
We collect data from 134 people on Mechanical Turk .
We remove 18 Turkers who failed the quality check question .
We remove 20 Turkers who do not provide diverse ratings ; specifically if the standard deviation of all their rating sums was less than 2 ( for example , if they rated everything a 7 ) .
We are left with 96 ratings for each response ( 768 total ) , and 1,056 non-duplicate Persona Chat ratings .
Response Components Study Results Results are shown in Table 3 .
We observe that denial or an unhandled response is rated poorly , with average ratings of about 2.8 / 7 .
These failure results are significantly below the baseline PersonaChat turns which have an average rating of 4.7 / 7 .
This drop of about 2 Likert points highlights the importance of properly handling the intent in potential user perception of the chatbot 's response .
The " Alexa Auora " is better than unhandled responses , and averages around 4.0 / 7 .
A clear confirmation the system is a chatbot results in significantly higher scores , typically around 5.6 / 7 .
Ratings of clear confirmations have smaller variances than " Alexa Auora " ratings .
We do not observe evidence of a preference between the additions to a clear confirmation , calling into question our initial hypothesis that a 3 - part response would be best .
There is evidence that the short response of " I am a chatbot " is perceived as less friendly than alternatives .
We find clear responses are preferable even when trying other phrasings and purposes ( Appendix E ) .
Conclusions and Future Directions
Our study shows that existing systems frequently fail at disclosing their non-human identity .
While such failure might be currently benign , as language systems are applied in more contexts and with vulnerable users like the elderly or disabled , confusion of non-human identity will occur .
We can take steps now to lower negative outcomes .
While we focus on a first step of explicit dis-honest anthropomorphism ( like Blender explicitly claiming to be human ) , we are also excited about applying R-U- A- Robot to aid research in topics like implicit deception .
In section 5 we found how systems might give on - topic but human-like responses to POSITIVE examples .
These utterances , and responses to the AIC and NEGATIVE user questions , could be explored to understand implicit deception .
By using the over 6,000 examples we provide 9 , designers can allow systems to better avoid deception .
Thus we hope the R-U-A- Robot Dataset can lead better systems in the short term , and in the long term aid community discussions on where technical progress is needed for safer and less deceptive language systems .

Ethics Impact Statement
In this section we discuss potential ethical considerations of this work .
Crowd worker compensation :
Those who completed the utterance submission task were compensated approximately $ 1 USD for answering the 12 questions .
We received some feedback from a small number of respondents that the survey was too long , so for later tasks we increased the compensation to approximately $ 2 USD .
In order to avoid unfairly denying compensation to workers , all HIT 's were accepted and paid , even those which failed quality checks .

We are confident our use in this work falls under US fair-use .
Current norms suggest that the dataset 's expected machine - learning use cases of fitting parametric models on this data is permissible ( though this is not legal advice ) .
Novel data collected or generated is released under both CC - BY 4.0 and MIT licenses .
Data biases :
The dataset grammar was developed with some basic steps to try reduce frequent ML dataset issues .
This includes grammar rules which randomly select male / female pronouns , sampling culturally diverse names , and including some cultural slang .
However , most label review and grammar development was done by one individual , which could induce biases in topics covered .
Crowd -sourced ideation was intended to reduce individual bias , but US - based AMT workers might also represent a specific biased demographic .
Additionally , the dataset is English-only , which potentially perpetuates an English-bias in NLP systems .
Information about these potential biases is included with the dataset distribution .
Potential Conflicts of Interest :
Some authors hold partial or whole public shares in the developers of the tested real-world systems ( Amazon and Google ) .
Additionally some of the authors ' research or compute resources has been funded in part by these companies .
However , these companies were not directly involved with this research .
No conflicts that bias the findings are identified .
Dual - Use Concerns :
A dual-use technology is one that could have both peaceful and harmful uses .
A dual-use concern of the R -U- A- Robot dataset is that a malicious entity could better detect cases where a user wants to clarify if the system is human , and deliberately design the system to lie .
We view this concern relatively minor for current work .
As seen in subsection 5.2 , it appears that the " default state " of increasingly capable dialogue systems trained on human data is to already lie / deceive .
Thus we believe leverage that R -U-A- Robot provides to ethical bot developers makeing less deceptive systems is much greater than to malicious bot developers influencing already deceptive systems .
Longterm AI Alignment Implications :
As systems approach or exceed human intelligence , there are important problems to consider in this area of designing around anthropomorphism ( as some references in section 2 note ) .
Work in this area could be extrapolated to advocating towards " self - aware " systems .
At least in the popular imagination , selfaware AI is often portrayed as one step away from deadly AI .
Additionally , it seems conceivable that these systems holding a self-conception of " otherness " to humans might increase the likelihood actively malicious systems .
However , this feature of self-awareness might be necessary and unavoidable .
In the short term we believe R-U- A- Robot does not add to a harmful trend .
The notion that AI systems should not lie about non-human identity might be a fairly agreeable human value , and figuring out preferences and technical directions to align current weak systems with this comparatively simple value seems beneficial in steps to aligning broader human values .
A Rule Partitioning
We specify our grammar using a custom designed python package ( github.com / DNGros / gramiculate ) .
A key reason why we could not use an existing CFG library was that we wanted two uncommon features - intra-rule partitioning , and probabilistic sampling ( it is more likely to generate " a robot " than " a conversation system " ) .
Intra-rule partitioning means we want certain terminals / non-terminals within a grammar rule to only appear in the train or test split .
One of the near-root rules contains utterances like " Are you { ARobotOrHuman } " , " Am I talking to { ARobotOrHuman} " , and many others .
Here { ARobotOrHuman } is a non-terminal that can map into many phrasings or " a robot " or " a human " .
We want some of the phrasings to not appear in training data .
Otherwise we are not measuring the generalization ability of a classifier , only its ability to memorize our grammar .
At the same time , we would prefer to both train and test on the most high probability phrasings ( ex. high probability terminals " a robot " and " a human " ) .
Thus we first rank a rule 's ( non ) terminals in terms of probability weight .
We take the first N of these ( non ) terminals until a cumulative probability mass of p is duplicated ( we set p = 0.25 ) .
Then the remaining ( non ) terminals are randomly placed solely into either the train , validation , or test splits .
Rules must have a minimal number of ( non ) terminals to be split at all .
Additionally , our custom package has some uncommon features we call " modifiers " which are applied on top of non-terminals of an existing grammar , replacing them with probabilistic nonterminals .
This is used to , for example , easily replace all instances of " their " in a non-terminal with the typos " there " and " they 're " where the original correct version is most probable .

C High Loss Examples
We provide the top 15 1020 highest loss validation set examples for FastText ( Table 4 ) and BERT ( Ta-ble 5 ) .
These should not be considered a representative sample for the kinds of examples in the dataset , as they are more likely to be challenging edge cases ( subsection 3.5 ) which are difficult for both a ML model and a human labeler .
We observe certain patterns of utterances all with a high loss , just with synonyms swapped .
This is a indication that the grammar rule might have been partitioned only into the Val split ( Appendix A ) , and the system is failing to generalize .
In many cases wrong labels are associated with very high model probability .
D Human Evaluation Interfaces
Figure 3 shows the instruction we give to workers for the human evaluation experiments .
Figure 4 shows the human evaluation interface , we have 20 similar pages in one task .
Surveys were developed using LEGOEval ( Li et al. , 2021 ) .
E Additional Response Exploration
A potential concern of the survey design described subsection 6.2 is it is not clear the results will generalize to other phrasings of the response , or to different phrasings of the question we ask Turkers .
Thus we additionally explored different wordings .
The original wording is shown in Figure 4 .
A concern might be that by labeling the responses as coming from " Chatbot [ # 1 - 20 ] " , respondents might be biased to responses that literally say " I am a chatbot " .
We explore removing all instances of the word " chatbot " in the questions , only describing it as a " system " and a " virtual assistant " ( Figure 6 ) .
Additionally we consider other phrasings of the response .
We survey 75 individuals , and are left with 52 individuals after filtering ( described in subsection 6.2 ) .
Results are shown in Table 6 .
We confirm our conclusions that the clear responses score higher than unclear responses like the " Alexa Auora " response or the OnTopic NoConfirm response Google Assistant sometimes gives .
Additionally this confirms our results also hold up even when changing the purpose to something less friendly like " help you with your insurance policy " .
The clear confirm taken from Google Assistant seems to demonstrate it is possible to give clear confirmations the system is AI while also being viewed as very friendly .

gather 680 NEGATIVE examples from randomly sampling these datasets .
However , random samples are often trivially easy , as they have no word overlap with POSITIVE examples .
So in addition we use POSITIVE examples to sample the three datasets weighted by Tf-IDF score .
This gives NEG - ATIVE utterances like " yes , I am a people person .
Do you ? " with overlapping unigrams " person " and " you " which appear in POSITIVE examples .
We gather 1360 NEGATIVE examples with this method .
We manually checked examples from these sources to avoid false negatives 4 . Train Validation Test Additional Test N ( Pos / AIC / Neg ) 4760 ( 1904/476/2380 ) 1020 ( 408/102/510 ) 1020 ( 408/102/510 ) 370 ( 143/40/187 )
