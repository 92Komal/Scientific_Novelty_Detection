Chinese Opinion Role Labeling with Corpus Translation : A Pivot Study
abstract
Opinion Role Labeling ( ORL ) , aiming to identify the key roles of opinion , has received increasing interest .
Unlike most of the previous works focusing on the English language , in this paper , we present the first work of Chinese ORL .
We construct a Chinese dataset by manually translating and projecting annotations from a standard English MPQA dataset .
Then , we investigate the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer methods , including model transfer and corpus translation .
We exploit multilingual BERT with Contextual Parameter Generator and Adapter methods to examine the potentials of unsupervised crosslingual learning and our experiments and analyses for both bilingual and multilingual transfers establish a foundation for the future research of this task 1 . * Corresponding author .
1 We release the code and way of obtaining Chinese dataset at https://github.com/zenRRan/ ChineseORL -with -Corpus-Translation .
Introduction Fine- grained opinion mining has been a crucial task in natural language processing ( NLP ) for a long time ( Kim and Hovy , 2006a ; Breck et al. , 2007 ; Wilson et al. , 2009 ; Qiu et al. , 2011 ; Irsoy and Cardie , 2014 ; Liu et al. , 2015 ; Wiegand et al. , 2016 ) and it aims to discover useful structural information of user opinions from unstructured text , which is the relation between expression and entities such as Who expressed what kind of sentiment towards what ?.
The EXPRESSION conveys attitudes including sentiments , agreements , beliefs , or intentions ( e.g. , voiced his condolences in Figure 1 ) ; the entities consist of the HOLDER who expresses the opinion ( e.g. , Chen . ) and the TARGET which the opinion is expressed to ( e.g. , the families ) ( Breck et al. , 2007 ; Yang and Cardie , 2012 ; Katiyar and Cardie , 2016a ) .
Here we focus on the opinion role labeling ( ORL ) task which is to identify opinion holders and [ Chen ] holder [ voiced his condolences ] expression to [ the families ] target . targets ( Marasovi ? and Frank , 2017 ; Zhang et al. , 2019a ) when the expressions are given .
Most of the previous researches focus on the English ORL , benefiting from the benchmark MPQA dataset ( Wiebe et al. , 2005 ) which includes spanbased annotations of opinion expressions , holders and targets .
The task is commonly solved by sequence labeling models with the BIO conversion scheme ( Kim and Hovy , 2006 b ; Choi et al. , 2006 ; Yang and Cardie , 2013 ; Johansson and Moschitti , 2013 ) .
Recently , neural BiLSTM -CRF models have achieved state - of- the - art performance on this task ( Katiyar and Cardie , 2016 b ; Marasovi ? and Frank , 2017 ; Zhang et al. , 2019a ) .
However , the studies on other languages are relatively rare due to the scarcity of annotated datasets .
To our best knowledge , there is only one exception by Almeida et al . ( 2015 a ) , which has annotated a small-scale dataset for the Portuguese language .
Unsupervised cross-lingual transfer ( Xu et al. , 2018 ) is one promising way to address the low resource problem for ORL .
Under the neural setting , there are two representative categories of methods : model transfer ( McDonald et al. , 2013 ; Swayamdipta et al. , 2016 ; Daza and Frank , 2019 ) and corpus translation ( Zhang et al. , 2019 b ) .
The model transfer trains a model on a resource - rich language by using only language - independent features such as multilingual BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ; Pires et al. , 2019 ) and then apply it to the target language .
The corpus translation approach firstly obtains parallel corpora through either human or machine translation and then projects the annotations from the source language to the target side .
In this work , we present the first study of the Chinese ORL .
First , we construct a benchmark corpus by manually translating the English MPQA corpus , which involves auto-translation ( i.e. , automatic sentence translation and opinion aligning ) and human refinement .
Second , we investigate the performance of unsupervised cross-lingual transfer for Chinese ORL based on the annotated corpus .
We investigate the Contextual Parameter Generator Networks ( PGN ) in multilingual BERT with Adapter ( known as parameter efficient in learning ) method ( ? st? n et al. , 2020 ) ( we call it PGN - Adapter ) and discover the complementarity of the model transfer and corpus translation methods .
We conduct experiments on the newly constructed Chinese dataset to evaluate our methods , together with the English MPQA corpus ( Wiebe et al. , 2005 ) and the Portuguese dataset ( Almeida et al. , 2015a ) for cross-lingual transfer .
We observe that for the unsupervised cross-lingual transfer from the English corpus , the translation - based method is better than the model transfer , and their combination leads to further improvements .
Although the scale of the Portuguese corpus is much smaller , adding it into the multilingual transfer still outperforms the bilingual counterpart .
To summarize , in this paper , we have the following contributions : ?
We manually translate and annotate a Chinese fine- grained ORL corpus for research purposes , especially for the cross-lingual ORL study . ?
We conduct cross-lingual ORL ( to Chinese ) through unsupervised model transfer and corpus translation with PGN - Adapter , setting up strong baselines for future research .
?
We perform extensive experiments and analyses to demonstrate the pros and cons of the different approaches .
Related Work Fine - Grained Opinion Mining
There have been a number of studies in fine- grained opinion mining ( Wilson et al. , 2009 ; Qiu et al. , 2011 ; Wiegand et al. , 2016 ) . Kim and Hovy ( 2006a ) exploit a semantic role labeller to extract opinion holders and topics .
Choi et al . ( 2005 ) Cross-Lingual Transfer Learning Crosslingual transfer learning has been extensively applied in NLP , including sentiment classification ( Zhou et al. , 2016 ) , POS tagging Wisniewski et al. , 2014 ; Kim et al. , 2017 ) , named entity recognition ( Zirikly and Hagiwara , 2015 ) , semantic role labeling ( Fei et al. , 2020 ) , and dependency parsing ( McDonald et al. , 2011 ; Tiedemann et al. , 2014 ; Guo et al. , 2016 ; Zhang et al. , 2019 b ) .
Unsupervised cross-lingual transferring has received great interest ( Duong et al. , 2015 ; Xu et al. , 2018 ) , which is our major focus .
The work of Zhang et al . ( 2019 b ) is mostly related to our study , which applies model transferring and corpus translation to dependency parsing .
Our work focuses on ORL , applying the two approaches for the Chinese language .
PGN - Adapter PGN - Adapter is used for merging different languages to same space by Adapter and PGN methods with BERT .
About the Adapter method which a pre-trained network added between the transformer encoder layer , there are many studies on using adapter modules ( Rebuffi et al. , 2018 ; Stickland and Murray , 2019 ; Houlsby et al. , 2019 ) ( 2018 ) , because 1 ) Google 's MT system is much better in 2020 than in 2018 .
Lower translation quality causes more problems for the argument mining ; while high- performance MT system enhances the translation - based approach .
2 ) Projection strategy is also different from ours ( Section 5.1 ) .
We choose to project the non-cross labels only , in order to ensure the mapping quality .
3 ) In addition , the more advanced methods like PGN , Adapter and BERT also play a significant role in cross-lingual tasks .
The Construction of Chinese Dataset
We manually construct a Chinese ORL dataset to facilitate our research .
In order to reduce the overall cost , we exploit corpus translation to assist the construction process , converting the English MPQA corpus ( Wiebe et al. , 2005 ; Wilson , 2008 ) into Chinese .
The conversion contains the following four steps by order : ( 1 ) sentence translation , ( 2 ) manual revision , ( 3 ) opinion projection , and ( 4 ) manual correction .
The first and third steps formalize into automatic corpus translation , which has been used as one approach for unsupervised cross-lingual transfer , and the second and fourth steps are used to ensure the final quality .
The whole construction is conducted at the sentence-level .
Sentence Translation Neural machine translation ( NMT ) has achieved state - of - the - art performances for a range of language pairs ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) .
In particular , the state- of- the - art NMT can reach a BLEU score over 45 ( Li et al. , 2019 ) .
Thus it is applicable to use NMT for automatic sentence translation .
Here we first translate all the English sentences of the MPQA dataset into Chinese by using the google translator 2 automatically .
Manual Revision Next , we let several native speakers check the translation quality , and make revisions to the imperfect translations .
There can be two types of revisions .
On the one hand , the translated sentences may have errors , and human Opinion Projection Third , we project all opinions ( expressions , holders and targets ) from the English sentence into its Chinese translation .
Before the projection , we use the Stanford Segmentor tool for word segmentation 3 .
The overall projection is supported by automatic word alignments , which can be produced by using a word-alignment tool .
Here we exploit the fast-align tool 4 ( Dyer et al. , 2013 ) to calculate the alignment probabilities .
Figure 2 shows an example to illustrate the projection process .
Concretely , given an English - Chinese sentence pair ( e 1 ? ? ? e n , c 1 ? ? ? c m ) and its English - to - Chinese alignment probabilities a( c j |e i ) , the projection is performed as follows : ( 1 ) We incrementally obtain the text spans in the Chinese sentences for the opinion expressions as well as their holders and targets in the English sentence .
( 2 ) For each word e i in the English sentence , we find its corresponding word c p i in the Chinese sentence by using p i = arg max j a( c j |e i ) , resulting in a set of one- one mapping word pairs : M = {( e 1 , c p 1 ) , ? ? ? , ( e n , c pn ) }.
( 3 ) For each span e i , j ( i.e. , expression , holder or target ) in the English sentence , we find its corresponding span c i , j in the Chinese sentence by maximizing the covered word - pair set M with the least span length .
( 4 ) We remove the projected span when ( j ? i ) ?
2 * ( j ? i + 1 ) which is regarded as low-quality .
If one expression is removed , its holder and target are removed as well .
Manual Correction
The last step is to perform another checking manually to ensure the quality of automatic opinion projection .
There could be several types of errors , including word boundary errors and miss-alignments .
And as for the continuity and fluency in the sentence , we do some trade-offs as shown in Table 2 .
By using the above four steps , we can obtain a benchmark dataset for Chinese ORL , the argument comparison about Chinese and English can be seen in Table 3 .
Noticeably , when we apply the corpus translation approach for unsupervised cross-lingual transferring , only the first and third steps are required , and all human interventions would be removed for full automation .
For corpus translation of other language pairs , one just need to replace English by the desired source language , and Chinese by the desired target language .
For manual revisions of the translated sentences and corrections of final ORL annotations , we recruit three volunteers , which are all native Chinese speaking and fluent in English .
For translation part , it is based on the result of machine translation and then we made a few minor corrections .
Two students modify it first by themselves , and then they proofread it together to select the better one between the two cases they translated .
If they have a conflict , the third one can make suggestions and get a final version .
As long as the sentence 's meaning is correct and conforms to Chinese habits , so we did not calculate translation 's kappa .
The kappa scores of word alignment are much higher , so we omit it in the paper .
Since the corpus is not built from scratch , it is constructed by translation .
Thus , the selected sentences are directly sourced from the English MPQA corpus .
The manual efforts of translation , as well as the alignment , are highly straightforward with little ambiguities .
For word alignment part , it is similar to the translation part .
Model Opinion role labeling aims to discover the opinion arguments given opinion expressions .
The task can be modeled as a sequence labeling problem ( Zhang et al. , 2019a ) .
We adopt the BMESO scheme to convert spans of opinion arguments into a sequence of word- level boundary tags , where B , M and E denote the beginning , middle and ending words of an argument , respectively , S denotes the word itself is an argument , and O denotes the rest of the words .
Formally , assuming that the input sentence is sent = w 1 , ... , w n , and a given opinion expression is expr = w b , ... , w e ( 1 ? b ? e ?n ) , our task is to assign a sequence of boundary tags t 1 , ... , t n .
We exploit a BiLSTM - CRF framework based on PGN - Adapter to implement our model .
Figure 3 shows an overview of our model .
the final encoder representation e i :
PGN - Adapter r i = c i + p i e i = SelfAttn( r i ; ? ada ) ( 1 ) where ? ada denotes the adapter modules .
Following Houlsby et al. ( 2019 ) , in this module , two adapters with two feedforward projections and a GELU nonlinearity are merged into each transformer layer as shown in Figure 3 .
To obtain the amount of sharing cross languages , we generate the trainable parameters of the adapter module by the PGN method .
The weights of the adapters are following : ? ada = W ada ? I e ( 2 ) where W ada is the parameters in adapter modules .
The parameters in the BERT model are frozen except the adapter part , thus our model can be much more parameter - efficient than fine-tuning , and meanwhile , our preliminary results show that the method does not hurt the performance .
I e is a language embedding by a multi-layer perceptron MLP lang : I e = MLP lang ( I t ) ( 3 ) where I t is a typological feature vector from the URIEL language typology database ( Littell et al. , 2017 ) . Following ?st?n et al. ( 2020 ) , we set our language embeddings from syntactic , phonological and phonetic inventory feature with k-nearest neighbors approach .
Further , word- level representations x 1 ? ? ?
x n can be derived by averaged pooling over the covered word pieces of each word .
BiLSTM -CRF
Following the front outputs , we apply bi-directional LSTMs ( BiLSTM ) and conditional random fields ( CRF ) ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ) to get high- level features and compute the probability of each candidate output tag sequence y = y 1 , ? ? ? , y n .
The concrete calculation method is defined as follows : h 1 ...h n = BILSTM ( x 1 , ... , x n ) o i = W h i , i ? [ 1 , n ] SCORE ( y ) = i? [ 1 , n ] o i [ y i ] + T [ y i , y i?1 ] p( y|sent , expr ) = e SCORE ( y ) y =y 1 , ? , y n e SCORE(y ) ( 4 ) where y traversing all candidate outputs , W and T are parameters .
We use the Viterbi algorithm based on SCORE ( y ) to search for the ORL tag sequence of the maximum score .
Training Objective
We exploit sentence - level cross-entropy loss for model training , which can be described as : L = ? log p( g = g 1 , ... , g n | sent , expr ) ( 5 ) where g = g 1 , ... , g n denotes the gold -standard tag sequence of a given sentence - expression pair .
Model Transfer
We use multilingual word representations to achieve the cross-lingual transfer of the model .
In particular , we use the pre-trained multilingual BERT - Base ( cased version ) 5 ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ) .
All pretrained parameters inside the BERT are frozen during ORL training .
Experiments
Datasets English Dataset .
We use the widely - adopted ORL benchmark dataset , the MPQA version 2.0 ( Wiebe et al. , 2005 ; Wilson , 2008 ) to evaluate our models .
We focus on identifying expression-holder and expression - target relations with expressions given .
We split the whole corpus into fixed training , development and testing sections .
Chinese Dataset .
We construct the Chinese dataset as described in Section 3 , and the basic statistics of the corpora are shown in Table 4 where we should point out that the reason for the number of auto-annotated opinion - arguments reduction is that we removed the cross labels .
The Chinese dataset consists of three parts : 1 ) manually translated and word-aligned from the English dataset ; 2 ) manually translated but automatically word-aligned ( Train en half ? auto ) ; and 3 ) automatically translated and word-aligned ( Train en auto ) .
The data splitting method is directly mapped from the corresponding English divisions for a fair investigation .
Portuguese Dataset .
We use the Portuguese ORL dataset released by Almeida et al . ( 2015 b ) for the cross-lingual transfer as well .
The whole dataset is used to help Chinese ORL .

Evaluation Metrics
As usual , we use precision ( P ) , recall ( R ) and ( Exact ) F1 - score to evaluate our methods .
Following ( Marasovi ? and Frank , 2017 ) , we exploit two additional soft evaluation metrics , binary and proportional overlapping scores .
In detail , Binary F1 treats an entity as correct if it contains an overlapping region with the gold-standard , and the proportional F1 assigns a partial score proportional to the ratio of the overlapping region .
Settings
The implementation of models of our experiments are Pytorch with version 1.4 and GPU device with V100 ( 32G ) .
There are several hyper-parameters contained in the model .
We set the output hidden size of BiLSTM to 200 and the layer number of BiLSTM to 3 .
To prevent overfitting , we set the dropout rate to 0.33 .
As for PGN - Adapter , we set the language embedding size in [ 16 , 32 , 50 , 64 ] , adapter size in [ 128 , 256 , 512 ] , language embedding dropout rate is 0.1 .
We exploit online training to learn model parameters , and use the Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) with learning rate 0.002 .
And the adapter module learning rate is 5e - 6 by AdamW optimizer ( Loshchilov and Hutter , 2017 ) .
The mini-batch size is set to 32 , and the parameters of the model are updated every 4 mini-batches .
We use gradient clipping by max norm 1.0 .
By default , we set the maximum epoch number to 40 to early stop , and evaluate development and test datasets every 160 steps .
At last , we select the final model when the development 's result is the best one .
Models
In order to make a better analysis of the experiment , we selected three models : BERT , Adapter , and PGN - Adapter .
BERT
We use multilingual BERT - Cased to be the baseline model .
Adapter
The Adapter modules in BERT can capture language -specific information automatically .
It also is a baseline to further verify the validity of the next model .
PGN - Adapter Compared with Adapter , PGN - Adapter model integrates PGN method in Adapter , and it incorporates richer language information from an external given language type .
To the best of our knowledge , this model is likely to be better at achieving the best possible performance for crosslanguage tasks .
The purpose of using this model is to better show the following model transfer and translation - based cross-lingual transfer methods .
Note that if the source and target languages are the same , only the first model , BERT , is used .
Experiment Results and Analysis
This section provides an overview of the English - Chinese transfer and multilingual transfer experiments on the basis of adding Portuguese to the Chinese target language .
Further , we analyze the results in detail .
In order to understand the performance of different roles ( i.e. , the HOLDER and TARGET ) , we measure the performance variance along with the span length of the arguments .
As for the cross-lingual analysis , apart from the MT - based setting , we also add one more semi-automatic setting , i.e. , manual translation with automatic alignment .
Just to be clear in advance , the following method CorpusTrans is using the fixed multilingual BERT embeddings only , no Adapter or PGN - Adapter method , as the Train , Dev and Test datasets are all in Chinese .
English - Chinese Transfer
Our experiments mainly focus on Chinese as the target language .
Table 5 shows the results of the English - Chinese transfer .
We observe that 1 ) almost all experiments using the PGN - Adapter model achieve the best results in each group ; 2 ) when manual translation and annotation are available , the model combining all the datasets performs the best : English , Chinese and automatic translation from the English corpus ; 3 ) comparing model transfer and automatic translation , the latter outperforms the former by a large margin ; and 4 ) if we combine the two approaches , we further improve the performance , although still inferior to the manual translation model .
In short , from English to Chinese , the translationbased method is in favor of the model transfer , even with machine - translated data .
Notice that , the " auto " approaches could be easily adapted into other language pairs without large labor costs .
Apart from Portuguese ( Section 6.2 ) , we will explore more low-resource target languages on the source side in the future .
Multilingual Transfer
In this section , we also conduct experiments by using multilingual transfer , thanks to the availability of the Portuguese dataset ( Almeida et al. , 2015 a ) .
For a fair comparison , we still focus on Chinese as the target language .
Adding the English and Portuguese , Table 6 displays the experimental results .
The first two train corpora ( 4 lines ) represent the model transfer and ( automatic ) translation - based methods with two languages , respectively .
The observations are similar to the bilingual settings .
When we combine the two methods , only a few indicators have improved .
When we compare the results with additional Portuguese data in Table 5 , we find that the model transfer benefits from the second source language , but in the corpus translation part , performance is noticeably decreasing , due to the low quality of the machine - translated data .
The reason behind this may be that according to the MT community , the English - Chinese MT system achieves a 45 + BLEU score ( Li et al. , 2019 ) , while Portuguese - Chinese MT is only around 20 ( Liu et al. , 2018 ) .
Influence of the Span Length Figure 4 illustrates the performance change along with the span length of the arguments , holder ( up ) and target ( down ) , respectively .
For the holder , the general tendency goes down , long spans with worse performance .
However , it is worth pointing out that the CorpusT rans method performs well at the long span holders , even higher than the HumanT rans method which is created by human translators .
We also see the M odelT rans makes a worse score in the long span , but adding the CorpusT rans obtains a similar performance with HumanT rans .
That is to say , model transfer and translation - based model together are very helpful for both long and short HOLDERs .
For the target , the best performances are all achieved for the middle - length spans , suggesting that the average length of the target is 4.8 words that is longer than 2.0 words about the holder .
We speculate that short spans may not contain enough semantics , while the longer span 's boundaries are not trivial to recognize correctly .
As for Combine , we see the score in the middle even higher than the manual translation ( HumanT rans ) , due to the mutual enhancement of the two methods .
Influence of the Automatic Alignment
In addition to the machine translation setting and manual translation setting and alignment setting , we also explore the setting of manual translation with automatic alignment .
Table 7 lists the results for comparison .
We observe that the automatic alignment setting ( with human translation ) performs the worst among the three configurations .
This might seem to be unexpected at the first glance , since the translation quality is still much better than the machine - translated ones .
We speculate that , since human translation and machine translation behave quite differently , MT systems rely more on word alignment , while humans usually translate the sentence as a whole .
The automatic alignment fails to transfer the annotations from the source side to the target .
Conclusions
We presented the first work of Chinese ORL .
First , we manually constructed a Chinese dataset with the help of corpus translation .
Then , we investigated unsupervised cross-lingual transfer for Chinese ORL .
We studied two different approaches , model transfer and corpus translation , respectively .
Experiments and analyses were performed based on the annotated dataset .
Results showed that unsupervised cross-lingual transfer is an effective method for Chinese ORL , and in addition , multisource transfer further improves the results which are promising for future exploration of such crosslingual transfer to other low-resource languages .
