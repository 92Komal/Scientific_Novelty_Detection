Neural Machine Translation in Low-Resource Setting : a Case Study in English - Marathi Pair
abstract
In this paper , we explore different techniques of overcoming the challenges of lowresource in Neural Machine Translation ( NMT ) , specifically focusing on the case of English - Marathi NMT .
NMT systems require a large amount of parallel corpora to obtain good quality translations .
We try to mitigate the low-resource problem by augmenting parallel corpora or by using transfer learning .
Techniques such as Phrase Table Injection ( PTI ) , back - translation and mixing of language corpora are used for enhancing the parallel data ; whereas pivoting and multilingual embeddings are used to leverage transfer learning .
For pivoting , Hindi comes in as assisting language for English - Marathi translation .
Compared to baseline transformer model , a significant improvement trend in BLEU score is observed across various techniques .
We have done extensive manual , automatic and qualitative evaluation of our systems .
Since the trend in Machine Translation ( MT ) today is post-editing and measuring of Human Effort Reduction ( HER ) , we have given our preliminary observations on Translation Edit Rate ( TER ) vs.
BLEU score study , where TER is regarded as a measure of HER .
Introduction
The aim of this work is to improve the quality of Machine Translation ( MT ) for the English - Marathi language pair for which less amount of parallel corpora is available .
One of the major requirements for good performance of the Neural Machine Translation ( NMT ) models is the availability of a large parallel corpora .
As a result , there is a need to come up with additional resources by augmenting parallel corpora or by using knowledge from other tasks using transfer learning .
Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya ( 2020 ) have shown that the lexical and orthographic similarities among languages can be utilized to improve translation quality between Indic languages when limited parallel corpora is available .
English and Marathi does not have common ancestry and hence are not related languages , whereas Hindi and Marathi are related languages .
Also , among the various English to Indic language corpora , English -Hindi corpus is comparatively larger .
In our pivot based transfer learning , combined corpus , and multilingual experiments we try to utilize this high resource English - Hindi language pair in various ways to assist in English - Marathi translation .
In our Phrase Table Injection ( PTI ) experiment , we explore how the phrases generated during Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) model training can be further utilized in NMT .
We also explore how the monolingual corpus of the target language can be leveraged to create additional pseudo-parallel sentences using back - translation .
We also try to understand the correlation between the BLEU and Translation Edit Rate ( TER ) scores by fitting a linear regression line on the TER vs BLEU graph , where TER is regarded as a measure of Human Effort Reduction ( HER ) .
Related Work Transformer model ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) was introduced in 2017 and gave significant improvements in the quality of translation as compared to the previous Recurrent Neural Network ( RNN ) based approaches ( Bahdanau et al. , 2014 ; Cho et al. , 2014 ; Sutskever et al. , 2014 ) .
Self-Attention and absence of recurrent layers enabled models to train faster and get better performance .
However , this did not help improve the translation quality in the low-resource setting .
Various methods have been proposed over the years to deal with the low-resource NMT problem .
Some methods which use monolingual data involve integrating a separately trained language model ( G?l? ehre et al. , 2015 ) into the decoder , using an autoencoding objective ( Luong et al. , 2015 ) or augmenting pseudo- parallel data using back - translation ( Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) .
Sen et al. ( 2018 ) introduced a method for combining SMT and NMT by taking phrases from SMT training and augmenting them to NMT .
introduced a transfer learning approach where a parent model trained on a high resource language pair is used to initialize some parameters of the child model , which is then trained on a low-resource language pair .
Kim et al. ( 2019 ) also uses a transfer learning approach with the help of a pivot language to learn parameters initially which are then transferred .
Multi-lingual NMT Firat et al. , 2016 ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ) is another approach which uses knowledge transfer among various languages to improve the performance of all the language pairs involved .
Our Approaches
In this section , we discuss the details of the various techniques that we have explored to deal with the problem of low-resource English - Marathi language pair .
Sen et al. ( 2018 ) and Dewangan et al . ( 2021 ) used this technique , shown in Figure 1 , to combine both SMT and NMT .
We know that the phrase table , generated during training of a SMT model , plays a key role in the SMT translation process .
It contains a probabilistic mapping of phrases from the source language to the target language .
The phrases present in the phrase table are combined with the available parallel corpora ; thereby increasing the data available to train the NMT model .
This also helps the model to learn translation of short correct phrases along with long sentences .
Phrase Table Injection ( PTI )
Expansion of data using Back-Translation Back-translation ( Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) is a technique that uses monolingual data of the target language to improve the translation performance of low-resource language Injection pairs .
The amount of available monolingual data in the target language typically far exceeds the amount of parallel data .
In SMT , this monolingual data can be used to train a language model , which accounts for fluent translations in SMT .
This ability of leveraging the monolingual data for training can be incorporated in NMT by the process of back - translation .
Initially , the available parallel corpora is used to train a Marathi-English NMT model .
This model is then used to translate the Marathi monolingual data to create a pseudo-parallel corpus , which in turn is combined with the available parallel corpora to train the NMT model .
The ratio of parallel corpora to pseudo- parallel corpora is tuned depending on various factors like quality of target to source model , languages involved in translation , to name a few .
Combined Corpus
In this technique we exploit the knowledge from similar languages on the target side .
As shown in Figure 2 , we first train a NMT model using combined corpora from English - Marathi and English -Hindi ( EnglishEnglish - HindiMarathi ) language pairs .
This model is then fine-tuned with the English - Marathi parallel corpora only , using the same vocabulary as that used while training .
The intuition is that a model which at the start of training knows how to translate mixed languages is better than a model initialized with random weights .
Figure 2 : Combined Corpus
This technique will be more effective if the languages at the target side are similar as this will potentially lead to a partial overlap in the target side vocabulary .
Here Hindi and Marathi are the target languages which are similar as both belong to the same language family ( Indo- Aryan ) and have an overlap in their alphabet set .
Transfer Learning Approach
The transfer learning approach we used utilizes a pivot language .
For the task of English to Marathi translation we use Hindi as a pivot language which assists this task .
We chose Hindi as the pivot language because Hindi and Marathi are linguistically close languages .
Also English -Hindi parallel corpus is larger as compared to other English to Indic language pairs .
We use two pivot based transfer learning techniques proposed by Kim et al . ( 2019 ) , both of which are discussed below .
Direct Pivoting
In this technique we train two separate NMT models , a source-pivot model and a pivottarget model .
As demonstrated in Figure 3 , we first separately train an English -Hindi ( source-pivot ) model ( task 1 ) and a Hindi-Marathi ( pivot-target ) model ( task 2 ) on their respective parallel corpus .
We then use the encoder of the English -Hindi ( source-pivot ) model and the decoder of Hindi-Marathi ( pivot-target ) model to initialize the encoder and decoder of the English - Marathi ( source- target ) model , respectively .
Finally , we finetune this English - Marathi ( source-target ) model using the available English - Marathi parallel corpus .
The problem with this approach is that the final English - Marathi ( source- target ) model is built by combining the encoder trained to produce outputs for the pivot decoder instead of the target decoder ; and the decoder trained on the outputs of the pivot encoder instead of the source encoder .
Step-wise Pivoting
As shown in Figure 4 , here we first train an English -Hindi ( source-pivot ) model .
Then we use the encoder of the English -Hindi ( source-pivot ) model to initialize the encoder of the Hindi-Marathi ( pivot-target ) model .
After this , we train the Hindi-Marathi ( pivottarget ) model on the Hindi-Marathi corpus by freezing the encoder parameters .
Then
Multi-Lingual MT System
The various types of multilingual models are one- to-many , many - to - one and many -tomany .
Among these , we use the one-to-many multilingual model with source language as English and target languages as Hindi and Marathi .
One of the ways to achieve this is by making use of a single encoder for the source language and two separate decoders for the target languages .
The disadvantage with this method is that , as there are multiple decoders , the size of the model increases .
Another way to achieve this is to use a single encoder and a single shared decoder .
An advantage of this method is that the representations learnt by English -Hindi task can further be utilized by the English - Marathi task .
Also , Hindi and Marathi being similar languages , the overlap between their vocabulary is large resulting in a smaller shared vocabulary .
Experiments
In this section , we discuss the details of the various experiments that we have carried out to improve the quality of the English - Marathi translation .
Dataset Preparation
The NMT models were trained using a corpus formed by combining the Indian Languages Corpora Initiative ( ILCI ) Phase 1 corpus ( Jha , 2010 ) , Bible corpus ( Christodouloupoulos and Steedman , 2015 ; Jha , 2010 ) , CVIT - Press Information Bureau ( CVIT - PIB ) corpus ( Philip et al. , 2021 ) , IIT Bombay English -Hindi corpus ( Kunchukuttan et al. , 2017 ) and PMIndia ( PMI ) corpus ( Haddow and Kirefu , 2020 ) .
The English - Marathi corpus , English -Hindi corpus and Hindi-Marathi corpus consisted of 0.25 M , 2 M and 0.24 M parallel sentences , respectively .
Barring the ILCI corpus , the remaining Hindi-Marathi data was synthetically generated by translating the English sentences
The English sentences are tokenized and lowercased using Moses 4 ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) toolkit .
The Hindi and Marathi sentences are lowercased and normalized using Indic NLP Library ( Kunchukuttan , 2020 ) . Byte Pair Encoding ( BPE ) ( Sennrich et al. , 2015 ) is used as a segmentation technique ; as breaking up words into subwords has become standard now and is especially helpful for morphologically rich languages like Marathi and Hindi .
Training Setup The Transformer architecture was used to train the NMT models .
The PyTorch version of OpenNMT ( Klein et al. , 2017 ) was used to carry out the PTI , combined corpus and back -translation experiments .
For the pivot language based transfer learning and multilingual NMT experiments , the fairseq ( Ott et al. , 2019 ) library was used .
The SMT model for PTI was trained using the Moses toolkit .
For the baseline model , a vanilla transformer model was trained using the default parameters 5 for 200 K training steps .
In the experiment with PTI , Moses toolkit was used to train the model to get phrases from the phrase table .
The grow-diag-finaland method was used for symmetrization and msd-bidirectional - fe method was used for lexicalized reordering .
While making batches for training , the parallel data and parallel phrases were selected in the ratio 4:1 , as giving less weightage to phrases enhances the performance .
For back - translation experiment , the amount of pseudo-parallel sentences used is same as that of the available corpus .
Both the corpus were combined and a model was trained with the default parameters .
In the combined corpus experiment , the model was trained for 200k training steps and then was further fine-tuned for 100k training steps .
For the pivot language based transfer learning experiments , a transformer model from the fairseq library was used .
The optimizer used was adam with betas ( 0.9 , 0.98 ) .
The initial learning rate used was 5e - 4 with the inverse square root learning rate scheduler and 4000 warm - up updates .
The dropout probability value used was 0.3 and the criterion used was label smoothed cross entropy with label smoothing of 0.1 .
All the models were trained for 400 epochs .
Same training setup was used for the multilingual NMT experiments as well .
A one ( English ) to many ( Hindi , Marathi ) multilingual model was used .
As the multilingual model we used had a shared decoder , the source sentence was prepended with a target language token , both at the training and the inference time , to specify the target language during translation .
Results and Analysis
We use the BLEU evaluation metric ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) to report our results .
Sacrebleu ( Post , 2018 ) python library was used to calculate the BLEU scores .
We detokenize the translated sentences before calculating the BLEU scores .
The results of all our experiments are summarized in Table 2 . Injection ) .
Model
In PTI experiment we observe an increase in BLEU score on WAT 2021 test set while the BLEU score on ILCI test set decreases .
For combined corpus there is improvement of more than 1.5 BLEU score on both the test sets , indicating that English -Hindi corpus helped during the training .
We observe that using back - translation , the BLEU score decreases .
This can be attributed to the fact that the Marathi- English model used for back - translating the Marathi monolingual corpora was not of good quality .
This Marathi-English model was trained using 0.25 M parallel sentences which affects the quality of back - translated data .
We also tried out experiments by combining the above mentioned methods , among which , the combination of phrase table injection and combined corpus methods give the best results .
The results of the direct pivoting technique show an improvement of 2.29 BLEU score over the baseline model on the ILCI test set and of 0.42 on the WAT 2021 test set .
The results of step-wise pivoting show an improvement of 1.91 BLEU score over the baseline on the ILCI test set and of 0.74 on the WAT 2021 test set .
The reason for this BLEU score increase is that , the encoder and decoder used to initialize the English - Marathi model before training have already learned some representations .
This is because the encoder and decoder are initialized from the encoder and decoder of the trained English -Hindi ( source-pivot ) and Hindi-Marathi ( pivot-target ) models , respectively .
We observe that this initialization of encoder and decoder performs better than a random initialization .
The results of the multilingual model on English - Marathi translation task show a BLEU score increase of 2.8 on the ILCI test set and 0.83 on the WAT 2021 test set over the baseline model .
In a multilingual model , we use a shared decoder for both the target languages , due to which , the representations learnt by the model for the task of English -Hindi translation helps in the English - Marathi task as well .
This leads to a better performance of the multilingual model over the baseline model .
For direct pivoting , step-wise pivoting and multilingual model we observe that the BLEU score increase on ILCI test set is more than that on the WAT 2021 test set .
Our conjecture is that as the size of the ILCI corpus used in training is larger than that of the PMIndia corpus ( from which WAT 2021 test set is derived ) , the BLEU score increase for ILCI test set is more .
Extensive Evaluation
In this section , we discuss the analysis that we have carried out to compare our models with baseline ; and also understand the correlation of BLEU score with TER , where TER is regarded as a measure of HER .
Qualitative Analysis
In this sub-section , we present the analysis of few sentences to demonstrate how our model performs better than the baseline .
In each of the below given examples , En-Source represents source English sentences , Mr-xx represents translated Marathi sentence using " xx " model , Mr-xx -Transliterate represents translated Marathi sentence transliterated in English , and Mr-xx - Gloss represents word-to - word English translations of the translated Marathi sentence .
? Example 1 : Translation of named entity En-Source :
The toy train from Kalka to Shimla is considered as the most beautiful rail line in India .
Mr-Baseline : ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . Mr-Baseline -Transliterate : kalka te shimlaa dhavanari railway bharatat cervat sunder railway laiin maanli jate .
Mr-Baseline - Gloss : Kalka to up - to - Shimla running railway in -India most beautiful railway line considered is .
Mr- DirectPivoting : ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? . Mr-DirectPivoting -Transliterate : kalkaapasun shimla paryantachi toy train bharatatil sarvat sundar railway laiin maanli jate .
Mr-DirectPivoting - Gloss : From -Kalka Shimla up - to toy train in - India most beautiful railway line considered is .
The English source sentence contains a named entity " toy train " .
The baseline translated " toy train " incorrectly as " ? ? " ( which means " railway " ) , whereas our model was able to translate " toy train " correctly as " ? ? ? ? " ( which means " toy train " ) .
?
Example 2 : Translation of long sentences En-Source : The Prime Minister expressed happiness that on this occasion , the devotional hymn Vaishnav Jan To , which was so dear to Bapu , had been rendered by artistes in about 150 countries across the world .
Mr-CombinedCorpus-Transliterate : pantprdhaan narendra modi yaanchyaa adhyakshatekhali kendriya mantrimandalaane bharat aani singapore darmyaan shahar niyojan aani vikas kshetraatiil sahakaaryaabaabatchyaa saamanjsy karaaraalaa kaaryottar manjurii dilii .
Mr Mr-CombinedCorpus-Gloss : Prime-Minister Narendra Modi his chaired - under central cabinet India and Singapore during city planning and development in - field regarding -cooperation Memorandum - of understanding after-work approval given .
The above example shows the performance of our model on sentences with low readability i.e. sentences with high Automated Readability Index ( ARI ) ( Senter and Smith , 1967 ) .
Our model was able to translate the low readability sentence adequately and fluently .
The trend in machine translation these days is to perform post-editing on the output of the MT system .
When post-editing is performed by humans on a large amount of sentences , it is very important to measure the reduction in human effort by the MT system .
This can be achieved by calculating the HER which can be an important MT evaluation metric .
In this paper , we use TER ( Snover et al. , 2006 ) as a measure of HER .
TER measures the amount of editing that is required by a human to convert a system output to a reference translation .
Understanding the Correlation between BLEU and TER
In order to understand the correlation between BLEU and TER scores , we plot sentencewise TER vs BLEU score graphs for the ILCI and WAT 2021 test sets .
Figure 5 shows that as the BLEU score increases the TER decreases .
A linear regression line was fitted on TER vs BLEU graph for both the ILCI and WAT 2021 test sets .
y = ?0.0117x + 0.8805 ( 1 ) y = ?0.0117 x + 0.9124
Equation 1 represents the linear regression line on the ILCI test set having slope of - 0.0117 and the y-intercept as 0.8805 .
Equation 2 represents the linear regression line on the WAT 2021 test set having a slope of - 0.0117 and the y-intercept as 0.9124 .
We observe that the slope of the line is negative for both the equations indicating that BLEU and TER are negatively correlated .
This is expected as BLEU is a measure of how good the sentence got translated , whereas TER is a measure of how bad the sentence got translated .
This supports the use of TER as a metric of HER .
Conclusion and Future Work
In this work , we have implemented and compared various techniques to improve the task of translation involving a low-resource English - Marathi language pair .
We have shown that the pivot based transfer learning approach can significantly improve the quality of the English - Marathi translations over the baseline by using Hindi as an assisting language .
We also observe that the phrases from the SMT training can help the NMT model perform better .
The one ( English ) to many ( Hindi , Marathi ) multilingual model is able to improve the English - Marathi translations by leveraging the English -Hindi parallel corpus .
Combined corpus experiment also uses the English -Hindi parallel corpus to improve the English - Marathi translation quality .
In future , we plan to further extend these approaches to a variety of languages to understand how the phenomenon of language relatedness can help improve the translation quality in low resource setting .
We also plan to explore how multiple pivot languages can be used while translating from some source to target language pair .
