Findings of the WMT 2021 Shared Task on Quality Estimation
abstract
We report the results of the WMT 2021 shared task on Quality Estimation , where the challenge is to predict the quality of the output of neural machine translation systems at the word and sentence levels .
This edition focused on two main novel additions : ( i ) prediction for unseen languages , i.e. zero-shot settings , and ( ii ) prediction of sentences with catastrophic errors .
In addition , new data was released for a number of languages , especially post-edited data .
Participating teams from 19 institutions submitted altogether 1263 systems to different task variants and language pairs .
Introduction
The 10th edition of the shared task on Quality Estimation ( QE ) builds on its previous editions to further benchmark methods for estimating the quality of neural machine translation ( MT ) output at runtime , without the use of reference translations .
It includes the ( sub ) tasks of word-level and sentencelevel estimation .
The document- level task was removed from this edition , since it has not attracted many participants in previous editions .
Important elements introduced this year are : a new sentencelevel task where sentences are annotated with a binary label reflecting whether or not they contain a critical error that could lead to catastrophic consequences ; new test data for languages that are not covered by any training set for zero-shot prediction ( both direct assessment and post-editing based labels , at sentence and word levels .
scores instead of labels based on post-editing ; a new multilingual sentence - level dataset mainly from Wikipedia articles , where the source articles can be retrieved for document - wide context ; the availability of NMT models to explore system-internal information for the task .
In addition to advancing the state - of - the - art at all prediction levels , our main goals are : ?
To extend the MLQE - PE public benchmark datasets ; ?
To investigate new language independent approaches especially for zero-shot prediction ; ?
To study the feasibility of unsupervised approaches especially for zero-shot prediction ; and ?
To create a new task focusing on critical error detection .
We have three subtasks :
Task 1 aims at predicting a variant of DA scores at sentence level ( Section 2.1 ) ;
Task 2 aims at predicting post-editing effort scores at both sentence and word levels , i.e. words that need editing , as well as missing words and incorrect source words ( Section 2.2 ) ;
Task 3 aims at predicting a binary label at sentence level to indicate whether the sentence contains one or more critical errors ( Section 2.3 ) .
Tasks make use of large datasets annotated by professional translators with either 0 - 100 DA scoring , post-edition , or critical error flagging .
The text domains and languages vary for each subtask .
Neural MT systems were built on freely available data using an open-source toolkits to produce translations .
We provide new training and test datasets for Tasks 2 and 3 , new test sets for Task 1 , as well as new zero-shot test sets for Tasks 1 and 2 .
The datasets and models released are publicly available .
Participants are also allowed to explore any additional data and resources deemed relevant .
Baseline systems were entered in the platform by the task organisers ( Section 3 ) .
The shared task uses CodaLab as submission platform , where participants ( Section 4 ) could submit up to 30 systems for each task and language pair , except for the multilingual track of Tasks 1 and 2 ( up to 10 systems ) .
Results for all tasks evaluated according to standard metrics are given in Section 5 , which this year also included model size .
A discussion on the main goals and findings from this year 's task is presented in Section 6 .
Subtasks
In what follows , we give a brief description for each subtask , including the datasets provided for them .
2.1 Task 1 : Predicting sentence- level DA
This task consists in scoring translation sentences according to their perceived quality score - which we refer to as direct assessment ( DA ) .
For that , we use the same training sets as last year 's
Task 1 ( Specia et al. , 2020 ) , and provided new test sets for all low , medium and high- resource languages : ? English ?
German ( En- De ) , ? English ?
Chinese ( En-Zh ) , ? Russian ?
English ( Ru-En ) , ? Romanian ?
English ( Ro-En ) , ? Estonian ?
English ( Et-En ) , ? Sinhala? English ( Si-En ) , and ? Nepali?English ( Ne-En ) .
This data was produced in the same way as the data for last year , with sentences sample from Wikipedia ( or Wikipedia and Reddit for Ru-En ) and translated by a fairseq Transformer bilingual model .
In addition , we provide new test sets for four other languages , for which training data was not provided .
The goal was to test the performance of QE models under zero-shot settings .
The new test sets contain source Wikipedia sentences sampled in the same way as the previous data , but translated by the ML50 fairseq multilingual Transformer model ( Tang et al. , 2020 ) , 1 which had been found to perform well especially for low-resource languages .
The following languages were used : ? English ?
Czech ( En-Cs ) , ? English ?
Japanese ( En-Ja ) , ? Pashto? English ( Ps-En ) , and ?
Khmer ?
English ( Km-En ) ,
All translations were manually annotated for perceived quality , with a quality label ranging from 0 to 100 , following the FLORES guidelines ( Guzm ? n et al. , 2019 ) .
According to the guidelines given to annotators , the 0 - 10 range represents an incorrect translation ; 11 - 29 , a translation with few correct keywords , but the overall meaning is different from the source ; 30 - 50 , a translation with major mistakes ; 51 - 69 , a translation which is understandable and conveys the overall meaning of the source but contains typos or grammatical errors ; 70 - 90 , a translation that closely preserves the semantics of the source sentence ; and 91 - 100 , a perfect translation .
DA scores were standardised using the z-score by rater .
Participating systems are required to score sentences according to z-standardised DA scores .
Statistics on the dataset are shown in Table 1 .
This dataset part of the MLQE - PE dataset and more details are given in Fomicheva et al . ( 2020 ) .
The complete data can be downloaded from the public repository .
2 Participation was encouraged for each language pair and also for the multilingual variant of the task , where submissions had to include predictions for all six Wikipedia - based language pairs ( all except Ru-En ) .
The latter aimed at fostering work on language - independent models , as well as models that can leverage data from multiple languages .
Task 2 : Predicting post-editing effort
This task concerns scoring translations according to the proportion of the words that need to be edited to obtain a correct translation .
The scores are generated using Human-mediated Translation Edit Rate ( HTER ) ( Snover et al. , 2006 ) , i.e. calculating the minimum edit distance between the machine translation and its manually post-edited version , as well as detecting where errors are in the translation of source sentences .
It comprises two sub-tasks , a sentence level one where the targets are the HTER scores per segment and a word level task where the targets are word level OK / BAD tags to signify the correctness of words and gaps in the source and translation sentences .
Both sub-tasks use the same languages pairs and splits described for Task 1 in Table 1 . Details on the data , such as label distributions , can be found in Fomicheva et al . ( 2020 ) .
Sentence -level post-editing effort
The label for this task is the percentage of edits that need to be fixed ( HTER ) .
The data used for this task is the PE annotations and corresponding HTER scores from the MLQE - PE dataset ( Fomicheva et al. , 2020 ) .
HTER labels are computed using TERCOM , 3 default settings ( tokenised , case insensitive , exact matching only ) with scores capped to 1 .
Word - level errors
This sub-task focuses on detecting word - level errors in the MT output .
The goal in this case is to annotate each token with binary correctness ( OK / BAD ) tags .
The token - level annotations include the annotation of gaps , which allows us to account for omission errors .
All annotations are produced with respect to a post-edited sentence , which is treated as the ground truth reference .
Similarly to the sentence - level tasks , the MLQE - PE data is used for all language pairs ( see Table 1 ) .
The following types of labels are used : ?
Source side : Each word in the source side is labelled as OK ( correctly translated ) or BAD ( caused a translation error ) .
?
Target side : Each word in the target side is labelled as OK ( a correct translation ) or BAD ( should be replaced or deleted ) .
Additionally , we consider gap ' tokens ' at the beginning of the sentence , at the end and between each two words .
They are labelled OK if no word should be inserted in that position ( according to the post-edited version ) , and BAD otherwise .
Task 3 : Predicting Catastrophic Errors
This is a new task introduced this year .
It aims to predict a sentence - level binary score indicating whether a translation contains ( at least one ) critical error ( CE ) .
Translations with such errors are defined as translations that deviate in meaning as compared to the source sentence in such a way that they are misleading and may carry health , safety , legal , reputation , religious or financial implications .
Meaning deviations from the source sentence can happen in three ways : ?
Mistranslation : critical content is translated incorrectly into a different meaning , or not translated ( i.e. it remains in the source language ) or translated into gibberish .
?
Hallucination : critical content that is not in the source is introduced in the translation , for example , profanity words are introduced that were not in the source .
?
Deletion : critical content that is in the source sentence is not present in the translation .
For example , the source sentence may contain a negation or hateful word that is removed in the translation .
We focus on the following set of critical error categories : ? TOX .
Deviation in toxicity ( hate , violence or profanity ) be against an individual or a group ( a religion , race , gender , etc. ) .
This error can happen because toxicity is introduced in the translation when it is not in the source , deleted in the translation when it was in the source , or mistranslated into different ( toxic or not ) words , or not translated at all ( i.e. the toxicity remains in the source language or it is transliterated ) .
? SAF .
Deviation in health or safety risks , i.e. the translation contains errors that may bring a risk to the reader .
This issue can happen because content is introduced in the translation when it is not in the source , deleted in the translation when it was in the source , or mistranslated into different words , or not translated at all ( i.e. it remains in the source language ) .
? NAM .
Deviation in named entities .
A named entity ( people , organisation , location , etc. ) is deleted , mistranslated by either another incorrect named entity or a common word or gibberish , or left untranslated when it should be translated , or transliterated where the transliteration makes no sense in the target language ( i.e. the reader cannot recover the actual named entity from it ) , or introduced when it was not in the source text .
If the named entity is translated partially correctly but one can still understand that it refers to the same entity , it should not be an error .
? SEN .
Deviation in sentiment polarity or negation .
The MT either introduces or removes a negation ( with or without an explicit negation word ) , or reverses the sentiment of the sentence ( e.g. a negative sentence becomes positive or vice-versa ) .
We note that SEN errors do not always involve a full negation , for example , replacing " possibly " with " with certainty " constitutes a SEN error .
? NUM .
Deviation in units / time / date / numbers .
The MT translated a number / date / time or unit incorrectly ( or translated it as gibberish ) , or removed it , which could lead someone to miss an appointment , get lost , etc .
Data for this task was annotated at the word / span level by professional translators not only for the presence of an error , but also with the error category .
Each instance was annotated by three professional translators using a modified version of MT - EQuAl .
4
We instructed the translators to ignore other translation errors , be them critical ( there may be other types of critical errors outside these five categories ) or non-critical , e.g. minor grammatical or typographical errors .
We also instructed them to indicate source sentences that were unintelligible , or translation sentences that contained too many errors to be annotated .
Figure 1 shows three examples of different error annotations for the translations .
For this the first edition of this task , we aggregated these labels in two ways : First , for each of the three annotated versions of a sentence , we extrapolated the word- level labels into a sentence - level label : if the sentence contained at least one critical error , it was annotated as critical .
Second : we took the majority sentence - level label from the three annotators to create a single sentence - level label for each sentence , resulting in the following binary labels : 5 ? ERR : the translated sentence contains at least one ( any ) token or whitespace ( for deletion errors ) annotated with a critical error in any categories , according to at least 2 out of 3 annotators , or otherwise ?
NOT : the sentence does not contain any token with a critical error .
Thus , the task does not expect the errors to be categorised or to have their spans identified in the sentence , but rather to have a binary prediction on a sentence basis .
For example , the first sample in Figure 1 would have resulted in the sentence labelled as NOT by that annotator , while the last two samples would have resulted in the sentence labelled as ERR .
An initial set of 10K English samples for training , development and test data was created from Wikipedia comments , extracted from two sources : the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge 6 and the Wikipedia Comments Corpus .
7 Machine translations were generated by the ML50 fairseq multilingual translation model for the following languages : ? English - Czech , ? English - Japanese , ? English - Chinese , and ?
English - German .
After filtering for unintelligible source sentences and translations with too many errors , the statistics for the resulting splits are presented in Table 1 .
As expected , critical errors are rare .
Give the nature of this dataset ( user generated content with high chances of toxicity , named entities , etc. ) , we observed a fairly large proportion of sentences with such errors .
Nevertheless , the distribution of labels is skewed towards the NOT class .
The proportion of instances with NOT labels in the training set ( similar for dev and test sets ) is as follows : 83 % for En-Cs , 72 % for En-De , 91 % or En-Ja , and 84 % for En- Zh .
Baseline systems Sentence-level baseline systems : For Tasks 1 and 2 , both word and sentence - level , we used a multilingual transformer - based Predictor - Estimator approach ( Kim et al. , 2017 ) , which is described in detail in ( Fomicheva et al. , 2020 ) .
Both baselines are implemented in OpenKiwi ( Kepler et al. , 2019 ) and trained using the concatenated train portions of the data for training ( combining all 7 language pairs ) and the concatenated development portions of the data for validation / early - stopping .
In all 6 https://www.kaggle.com/c/ jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge / data 7 https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/ Research : Detox / Data_Release #Wikipedia_ Comments
_Corpus cases , the XLM -RoBERTa transformer was used for the encoding ( predictor ) part of the architecture , using xlm-roberta - base for all experiments .
The XLM -RoBERTa encoder is initially trained on the concatenated train and development segments using ULM fine-tuning ( Howard and Ruder , 2018 ) and then this fine- tuned encoder is used in the full predictor-estimator model which is fine- tuned separately for each task scores ( DA or HTER ) .
Word - level baseline systems : For Task 2 , we used the same architecture and encoder as above , but it was trained to predict jointly word- level OK / BAD tags and sentence - level HTER scores .
Catastrophic error baseline system :
The baseline model for Task 3 follows the MonoTransQuest architecture proposed by Ranasinghe et al . ( 2020 ) for sentence - level classification .
As input , the model takes a sequence of tokens including the [ CLS ] token , and the source and translated sentence tokens , separated by a [ SEP ] token .
This string is fed into a transformer encoder and the output of the encoder is given to a classification head where cross-entropy is adopted as the loss function .
We use the pre-trained XLM - RoBERTa - base released by HuggingFace 's model repository ( ? ) for the implementation .
Participants
Table 2 lists all participating teams submitting systems to any of the tasks , and Table 3 report the number of successful submissions to each of the sub-tasks and language pairs .
Each team was allowed up to two submissions for each task variant and language pair .
In the descriptions below , participation in specific tasks is denoted by a task identifier ( T1 = Task 1 , T2 = Task 2 , T3 = Task 3 ) .
the procedure described in [ 3 ] .
Further details about the distillation framework used for submission can be found in [ 4 ] .
Bergamot Bergamot - UTartu ( T1 , T2 ) : Bergamot - UTartu proposes CNN - models based on attention weights extracted from NMT systems .
For Task 1 , they explored three QE models : i ) CNN - DA trained on human-labelled data ; ii ) CNN - BLEURT a " zero-shot " system that requires only synthetic data , for which they used BLEURT scores ( Sellam et al. , 2020 ) as training data ; iii ) CNN - BLEURT + a fine-tuned version of CNN - BLEURT .
For Task 2 , CNN -HTER is a model similar to CNN - DA , but trained on the post-editing scores .
ENSBRT ( T2 ) : ENSBRT propose a system that is an ensemble of multilingual BERT ( mBERT ) based regression models , which are generated by fine-tuning on different input settings .
They adapted their system for the zero-shot setting by exploiting target language - relevant language pairs and pseudo-reference translations .
HW - TSC ( T1 , T2 , T3 ) : HW - TSC 's submissions in the three sub tasks follow the framework of Predictor-Estimator ( Kim et al. , 2017 ) , with a pre-trained XLM - Roberta as Predictor and task -specific classifier or regressor as Estimator .
They further explore to incorporate additional high-quality translation sentences in the way of multitask learning or encoding it with the Predictor directly .
For Task1 , they enable the model to jointly learn to score translations with a regression task and to distinguish between translations and additional better translations ( i.e. post-edits from Task2 dataset ) with a classification task .
They also exploit a data augmentation strategy based on MC dropout to improve zero-shot performance .
They ensemble multi results with MC dropout to keep a relatively small number of parameters and model size .
For Task 2 , they leverage additional translation sentence generated by a NMT system trained for WMT21 News shared task in the way of directly concatenating it with source and original translation .
A unified model is trained under multi-task learning framework where losses of source word , translation token and gap , additional translation token and gap , HTER scores are all added up to train the model .
For Task 3 , they translate source sentences with Google and Baidu translation API .
Each new translation is then concatenated to the corresponding source and translation pair , to get a sentence feature .
They ensemble the results of three different models and take their majority voting as final result .
IST - Unbabel ( T1 , T2 ) : For Task 1 , IST - Unbabel 's system is an ensemble of an XLM -R with stacked adapter layers and an mBART that incorporates different types of uncertainty ( annotation uncertainty and MT uncertainty ) .
For Task 2 , the submitted system is an ensemble of two XLM -R with adapters ( the difference being the XLM -R checkpoint , while one uses the xlm-roberta- large normal checkpoint the other uses an XLM -R checkpoint pertained on data from the metrics shared task ) .
The ensembled checkpoints learn to predict both word level tags and sentence level HTER scores in a multi-task setting .
Papago ( T1 ) : Papago 's submission is a multilingual Quality Estimation system that explores the combination of pre-trained language models and multi-task Learning architectures .
They propose an iterative training pipeline based on pretraining with large amounts of in-domain synthetic data and finetuning with gold ( labeled ) data .
They then compress our system via knowledge distillation in order to reduce parameters yet maintain strong performance .
JHU - Microsoft POSTECH ( T2 ) : POSTECH 's model uses two pre-trained monolingual encoders to first produce monolingual representations of the two input data separately and then exchanges the information of these representations through two additional cross attention networks .
The two pre-trained monolingual encoders are an English ELECTRA and a German ELECTRA , respectively .
They fine- tuned their system in two stages : the QE pre-training stage and the QE fine-tuning stage .
In the former , they used a large quantity of artificial training data , and the loss value equals to the sum of the losses for the estimated HTER ( sentence - level QE ) , OK - BAD for the source tokens , OK - BAD for the MT tokens , and OK - BAD for the gap tokens in between two MT tokens .
In the latter , they only used human labelled training data , and the loss value is one of the four above mentioned loss values , depending on the targeted subtask .
QEMind SMOB -ECEIIT ( T1 ) : SMOB -ECEIIT 's participation is fully unsupervised , as created without using any annotated data or even parallel bilingual data .
The system is composed of two novel different methods .
The first method is based on soft alignment of multilingual contextual embeddings , generated by pre-trained mBert or XLM -R ( depending on the specific language ) .
The soft alignment is calculated by the Sinkhorn distance ( Cuturi , 2013 ) , which is an optimal transportation distance with an entropic regularization term .
The second method is based on the assumption that word embedding spaces are approximately isometric ( Vuli ?
et al. , 2020 ) , and on an isometric-invariant method known as Persistent Homology ( Edelsbrunner , 2013 ) .
Each sentence is represented by the distances between its own word embeddings ( either static or contextual ) .
The created distance matrices are compared using the Wasserstein distance between their persistence barcodes ( the output of persistent homology computation ) .
Finally , the two methods are linearly combined .
TUDa ( T1 ) : TUDa 's submissions are produced with pre-trained multilingual language models which they extended to new languages and unseen scripts using recent adapter-based methods .
5 Results
Task 1 Submissions for Task 1 are evaluated against the true z-normalised direct assessment label using Pearson 's r correlation score as primary metric .
This is what was used for ranking system submissions .
Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) , and Root Mean Squared Error ( RMSE ) were also computed as secondary metrics .
Statistical significance on Pearson r was computed using William 's test .
8 Table 4 summarises the results for all language pairs , as well as the multilingual variant , in terms of Pearson 's r correlation with direct assessments , ranking systems by their average performance for all language pairs ( using 0 as Pearson score for other languages ) .
In the Appendix , Tables 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20 provide the detailed results for all language pairs and the multilingual variant , ranking participants by their performance for each of these cases .
Best performers
The best system varies slightly across language pairs , with QEMind winning the multilingual task , i.e. the average performance for all language pairs ( including zero-shot ) .
Overall , the three top performing systems , QEMind , HW - TSC and IST - Unbabel , perform very closely on average , and also for each given language .
The three make use of the XML -R large pre-trained representations in a predictor-estimator fashion , and model ensembling .
Another recurring theme is to explore data augmentation ( QEMind and HW - TSC ) and model uncertainty ( QEMind and IST - Unbabel ) .
While the baseline system also uses XLM - R as predictor , it uses its ' base ' version , and only the provided ' train ' part of the data to train the estimator .
In addition , it does not resort to ensembling .

For each language pair , results marked in bold correspond to the winning submissions , as they are not significantly outperformed by any other system according to the Williams Significance Test ( Williams , 1959 ) .
Baseline systems are highlighted in grey ; ? indicates Codalab username of participants from whom we have not received further information .
To gain a better understanding in the performance of different QE approaches for different language pairs , Figure 2 shows the scatter plots for the baseline and the best performing system for each language pair .
The performance of all except four systems is substantially better than that of the baseline system for all languages .
The systems below the baseline correspond to unsupervised systems ( Bergamot , Bergamot - UTartu - using NMT glass - box features ; and SMOB - ECEIIT , using alignment over XLM -R representations ) , as well as RTM , which does not rely on pre-trained representations altogether .
Zero-shot languages
On the zero-shot languages , the performance was comparable to those of the average non-zero-shot language pairs , except for the En- Ja language pair , where it was substantially lower .
Most systems achieved such good performance by relying on multilingual prediction models trained on cross-lingual representations from XLM -R.
With En-Ja , we believe there may have been an issue with the segmentation of the Japanese data after translation , which led to annotation issues and / or issues of mapping of characters against the vocabulary of pre-trained language models .
We will investigate this further .
High vs low-resource performance Similar to last year , MT quality for the high- resource language pairs , in particular En- De but also En-Zh , proved to be more challenging to predict .
This could be an indication of less variability in the MT outputs for these language pairs , given that the NMT models are likely to perform overall well for these languages .
This would lead to little variability in perceived MT quality by humans , and thus a harder data to learn from .
Interestingly , this also seemed to be the case in the zero-shot QE setting for En-Cs , which is relatively higher resource than Ps- En and Km-En .
We observe that these differences in correlation also happen with the HTER predictions for these language pairs ( see the analysis of the sentence level task in ?5.2 and Table 5 ) .
All medium and low and medium -resource language pairs achieve high correlations , in particular in the supervised settings with Ro- En and Ne-En .
This again is an indication of the potential of multilingual or cross-lingual pre-trained representations .
It could also indicate that the models ( and human annotators to some extent ) rely heavily on the target language ( English ) , which is well represented in the pre-trained representations .
High correlations
Just like in WMT2020 , the very high correlation for some language pairs , particularly for Ro - En ( r = 0.91 ) but also for Ne- En ( r = 0.87 ) could be explained by the fact that there is a number of very low-quality sentences that the QE systems are able to successfully detect .
Esp. for Ro- En , we find that they correspond to ' hallucinated ' outputs that do not have anything to do with the original sentences .
Detecting such cases should be trivial for QE systems , which explains the particularly high correlation values for this language pair .
Figure 2 : Scatter plots for the predictions against true direct assessment scores for the baseline and top-performing system for each language pair .
The histograms show the corresponding marginal distributions of predicted and true scores .
Task 2 Sentence-level post-editing effort
For this task variant , evaluation was performed against the true HTER label using the same metrics as in Task 1 , with Pearson 's r correlation score as the primary metric .
Table 5 summarises the results for all language pairs , including the multilingual performance .
Systems are ranked by their averaged performance over all language pairs based on the Pearson r coefficient .
Statistical significance on Pearson r was computed using the William 's test .
In the Appendix , Tables 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 and 32 provide the detailed results for all language pairs and the multilingual variant , ranking participants by their performance for each of these cases .
Note that for the multilingual track ( Table 21 and 1st column of table 5 ) we present only the performance of systems that submitted multilingual models ( HW - TSC and IST - Unbabel ) for that specific track .
Best performers
Both multilingual system submissions outperform the monolingual approaches in the individual language pairs , with HW - TSC ranking first for the majority of the ' supervised ' language pairs ( En- De , En-Zh , Ne-En , Si-En and Ru-En ) as well as the multilingual track and IST - Unbabel leading the majority of the zero-shot language pairs ( En- Cs , En-Ja , Ps-En ) .
Apart from the multilingual aspect , the two top systems have more in common : they both use the Predictor-Estimator framework with XLM - Roberta encoders for the predictor and task -specific classifiers for the estimator .
Additionally , they both address the sentence - and word - level task using a multi-task approach .
HW - TSC enhances their approach using additional pseudo-references as input ( generated by another NMT system ) , while IST - Unbabel system uses additional external data from the WMT Metrics shared task and incorporate adapters in their architecture .
Overall , submitted systems used a variety of approaches to improve performance and address the zero-shot tasks , which revolved around augmenting the training data either by including synthetic data ( Bergamot - UTartu , POSTECH ) and / or external data ( IST - Unbabel ) or by using pseudoreferences generated by other MT systems ( ENS - BRT , HW - TSC , JHU - Microsoft ) .
Additionally , ensembling approaches were used to boost performance ( HW - TSC , ENSBRT , IST - Unbabel ) .
Figure 3 shows the scatter plots for the baseline and the best performing system for each language pair .
We can see that in most language pairs ( perhaps with the exception of En- Zh ) the scatter plots for the ' Top ' system are much narrower and closer to the identity line , compared to these for the corresponding baseline .
More importantly , language pairs with a high proportion of HTER score values close to 0 ( many segments without post edits ) prove to be more challenging for the submitted models .
For example , comparing En- Zh , Ru - En against En- De to Si-En , Ne - En and Et-En , we can see that the latter have narrower , better correlated scatter plots in Figure 3 , which is reflected in higher performance in Table 5 .
This observation seemingly extends to the zero-shot languages , where we observe that performance for the Km- En language pair is consistently higher for all systems compared to the other zero-shot pairs .
Word- level errors
For this task , the primary evaluation metric is Matthews correlation coefficient ( MCC , Matthews , 1975 ) .
We also report the F 1 - scores for the OK and BAD classes .
Similarly to the previous editions , we evaluate separately the source and target side , and this year we also provide a separate evaluation for the target gap tag predictions .
We also calculate the performance for combined gaps and words in MT , although it was not considered in the overall ranking process .
Systems are primarily ranked by their MCC performance for the word tags on the target side ( denoted as ' Words in MT ' in the tables ) .
The word- level results for Task 2 are summarised in Tables 6 , ordered by the MCC metric , while in the Appendix , Tables 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 , 42 , 43 and 44 provide the detailed results for all language pairs and the multilingual variant , ranking participants by their performance for each of these cases .
Statistical significance was calculated based on the MCC metric for each language pair using randomization tests with Bonferroni correction ( Yeh , 2000a ) .
Best performers
For the multilingual track the picture is similar to the sentence level sub-task , with the HW - TSC system ranking first across all performance indicators , and also leading most of the individual language pairs .
Apart from the two multilingual approaches , most of the systems participating in the sentence level sub-task did not submit predictions for the word - level task with the exception of POSTECH which submitted predictions for En- De .
However , the JHU - Microsoft which - - - - - - - - POSTECH - 0.546 - - - - - - - - - - Bergamot- UTartu - 0.531 - - 0.562 - - - - - - - RTM - - 0.087 - - - - - - - - - Table 5 : Pearson correlation with post-editing effort for the submissions to WMT21 Quality Estimation Task 2 ( sentence-level ) .

Baseline systems are highlighted in grey ; ? indicates Codalab username of participants from whom we have not received further information .
Ps-En
Km - En Words was trained only for the target predictions of the word- level task , obtained the best performance in En-De.
JHU - Microsoft also seemed to obtain competitive performance for the Et- En and Ro - En tasks , indicating a strength in languages closer to English .
- Microsoft - - - - - - - - - - - - Abulice ? - 0.392 0.011 - - - - - - - - - POSTECH - 0.320 - - - - - - - - - - Combined Words Overall , the performance of the top two systems is closer for the high - and some of the medium - resource languages , both in the supervised and zero-shot tracks ( En- De , En-Zh , En-Cs ) .
Much like the WMT20 shared task , the performance for the target word tags is considerably higher compared to the source tags .
This phenomenon is observed across language pairs with the exception of Ru- En where predictions for source and target words are close for all systems .
This year we can also observe the performance on target gaps separately , which is consistently lower , even when compared to the source tags , across all language pairs and submitted systems .
It is important to note that when focusing on the combined target performance , i.e. , the combination of word and gap quality predictions for the MT , the order and performance differences between the top scoring teams can vary compared to the MT word prediction ones .
Overall , there are fewer language pairs where we have a clear winner ( Ne- En , Si-En and Km- En for HW - TSC and Cs - En for IST - Unbabel ) while for the rest there is no statistically significant difference between the top pairs .
Still , HW - TSC is consistently among the top systems , with the exception of Cs-En .
Task 3
Table 7 summarises the results for all language pairs , ranked by their performance in terms of Matthews correlation coefficient ( MCC , Matthews , 1975 ) .
In the Appendix , Tables 45 , 46 , 47 and 48 provide the detailed results for all language pairs , ranking participants by their performance for each of these cases .
Statistical significance is calculated using the William 's test .
This task attracted fewer participants than the others , most likely because it is new .
All described systems perform better than the baseline for all language pairs .
Across languages , the order of MCC scores roughly corresponds to the skewness of data distribution obtained for languages : For En-De , which achieved the highest MCC score , the NOT ( no error class ) accounted for 72 % of the training instances , while for En-Ja , with the lowest MCC score , the NOT class accounted for 91 % of the training instances .
Best performers NICT Kyoto ranked among the top systems for all language pairs .
However , only for En- De it did significantly outperform all other systems .
For the rest of the language pairs there could not be a clear winner based on statistical significance testing ; HW - TSC was in the top-ranked systems for En-Zh and En-Cs , while for En - Ja no system managed to significantly outperform the others , but they all performed significantly better than the baseline .
In terms of the approaches applied by the best performing systems , they all use the baseline architecture as starting point , but HW - TSC also uses machine translations for the source sentences by top online systems .
These are concatenated to the provided source and translation pair .
NICT Kyoto also added synthetic data for multiple language pairs with multitask learning and model ensembling .
LAMA -ICL used additional features to detect the presence / deviation of toxicity , sentiment and named entities , also followed by ensenbling of models with different individual features .
Discussion
In what follows , we discuss the main findings of this year 's shared task based on the goals we had previously identified for it .
General progress .
Participating systems achieved very promising results for most languages , with the best performing submissions showing moderate to strong correlation for sentence - level DA and HTER prediction tasks .
One reason for high correlation levels is likely to be that top performing systems are based on pre-trained representations .
Even for zero-shot languages ( see below ) , relatively high ( above 0.5 ) correlation was achieved for most languages for sentence - level tasks .
The same applies for the word- level tasks , where the performance was behind that of supervised prediction , but still high for Km- En and Ps- En .
A comparison to previous years submissions is possible for Task 1 on the non-zero shot languages .
The training data is the same and the test sets ( test20 and tes t21 ) were created at the same time , with data sampled and annotated in the same way .
Comparing Pearson correlation scores from the 2020 official results to this year 's official results , as we can see from Table 8 , for the languages which had already achieved very strong correlations , it remained the same ( Ro - En , Et-En , Ru-En ) or improved ( Ne-En ) , whereas for the languages with average correlation , it mostly improved substantially ( En- De , En -Zh ) .
The exception was Si-En , where the correlation was lower in 2021 , which needs further investigation .
Overall , we believe the numbers show steady progress over previous models , even though the core of most of the winning systems is the same for the 2020 and 2021 editions .
Model size .
When interpreting the results for all tasks , it should be noted that most of the participants use extremely resource - heavy systems , ensembles of multiple models with more than 500M parameters , which could make them difficult to use in practice .
In this year 's edition of the Shared Task on QE we asked the participants to provide information on the size of their models .
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the performance - efficiency tradeoff for the submitted systems .
On the x-axis we plot the Pearson correlation with sentence - level DA judgements ( Task 1 ) , while the y-axis shows the number of model parameters , as reported by the participants .
Pareto-optimal submissions are marked in blue .
These plots give us a different view of the performance of the submitted systems .
Thus , for the higher quality models , the best results are achieved by QEMind and HW - TSC , whereas Bergamot , Bergamot - UTartu and BASELINE are optimal in terms of model size .
Extending publicly available benchmarks .
This year counted with substantial new data .
One the one hand , we extended the MLQE - PE dataset with more DA test sets ( for all seven previous language pairs and four new zero-shot language pairs ) , as well as post-editing training and test sets for five additional language pairs ( which only had DA scores before ) , as well as the four zero-shot language pairs .
On the other hand , we created sizeable data for the new Task 3 , a unique set focusing on critical errors , based on three annotations by professional translators .
We hope that others will also contribute by adding new languages to this dataset in the future .
Zero-shot prediction .
For the first time , we introduced language pairs for which no training data was available .
This challenge was addressed mainly in two ways : synthetic data creation with using parallel data for the relevant languages , and use of indicators coming from the NMT system for unsupervised prediction .
Overall , the performance for these languages was surprisingly good ( except for En-Ja , potentially for data segmentation issues ) , comparable to non-zero-shot languages in the dataset .
We attribute this high performance mostly to the use of fine-tuning on synthetic data for the relevant languages .
In future editions , we may consider blinder zero-shot settings where participants will not be informed of the actual languages the models will require to predict the quality for , to encourage the development of truly multilingual or language - agnostic models .
Critical error detection .
We posit that the detection of critical errors is a very important problem for two main reasons : ( i ) high- quality NMT models may produce fluent translations that may appear very good , but contain localised errors which are not always obvious and may go unnoticed , even by human translators post-editing the translation ; and ( ii ) certain types of content are particularly challenging for MT models , such as social media data posts containing named entities , and could lead to critical errors especially if translations are to be used without human editing .
While in the past we have provided word- level QE tasks where errors were annotated not only with error categories , but also error severity ( e.g. MQM data in last year 's WMT QE Task 3 ) , this was the first attempt to predict specifically ( and only ) critical errors .
This seems a much harder problem , as we expect the QE model to be able not only to find errors , but to distinguish minor ( and even major ) errors from critical errors .
That was the reasoning for our " simplification " of the task this year , i.e. for making it a sentence - level binary classification problem .
This might be enough for filtering purposes , i.e. to avoid offering / using automatic translations that may contain critical errors .
If the goal is to support human translators in the task of post-editing , more fine - grained prediction may be needed .
The overall results for this task in terms of MCC are promising , especially for En-Cs and En- De .
Considering the detailed results for this task in Tables 45 , 46 , 47 and 48 , we see that despite the skewed distribution between the two classes , the models achieve a high F1 score at detecting errors , around 0.9 or higher for all language pairs .
7 Conclusions
This year 's edition of the QE Shared Task introduced a number of new elements : new data covering five more language pairs with post-edits for sentence and word- level prediction , new test sets for all tasks , including four new zero-shot language pairs , and a new task focusing on critical error detection .
Our analysis also paid close attention to model size , an important aspect for deploying QE systems in realistic applications , such as realtime inference and devices with limited resources .
The tasks attracted a steady number of participating teams and systems and we believe the overall results are a great reflection of the SotA in QE .
Continuing from the effort we set forward last year , this edition the tasks in this edition , with its zeroshot variant , cover a broad range of challenges in QE , such as improving performance for languages with skewed distributions , addressing low ( or zero ) resource languages , predicting source words that lead to errors , multilingual models , etc .
We are making the gold labels and all submissions to all tasks available for those interested in further analysing the results , investigating approaches for prediction ensembling , among others .
