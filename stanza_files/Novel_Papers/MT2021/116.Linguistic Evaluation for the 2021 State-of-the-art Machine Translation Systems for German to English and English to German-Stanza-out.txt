Linguistic evaluation for the 2021 state- of- the- art Machine Translation systems for German to English and English to German
abstract
We are using a semi-automated test suite in order to provide a fine- grained linguistic evaluation for state - of - the - art machine translation systems .
The evaluation includes 18 German to English and 18 English to German systems , submitted to the Translation Shared Task of the 2021 Conference on Machine Translation .
Our submission adds up to the submissions of the previous years by creating and applying a wide - range test suite for English to German as a new language pair .
The fine- grained evaluation allows spotting significant differences between systems that cannot be distinguished by the direct assessment of the human evaluation campaign .
We find that most of the systems achieve good accuracies in the majority of linguistic phenomena but there are few phenomena with lower accuracy , such as the idioms , the modal pluperfect and the German resultative predicates .
Two systems have significantly better test suite accuracy in macroaverage in every language direction , Online -W and Facebook - AI for German to English and VolcTrans and Online -W for English to German .
The systems show a steady improvement as compared to previous years .
Introduction Evaluation in NLP and particularly in Machine Translation ( MT ) is an essential process for identifying flaws and leading further system improvements .
Nevertheless , the exact method of evaluation to be used varies , given the quality requirements of the particular use case .
Whereas the vast majority of the evaluation methods reside on metrics or direct assessment by humans to produce a single quality score given an entire test set , a recent trend has opted to evaluating the details of the produced translations , with major focus on their correctness from a linguistic perspective .
For this reason , the translation systems are not tested based on generic test-sets , but they are given input which is particularly crafted to trial their performance .
Most commonly , this is done with the help of a test suite ( cf. Guillou and Hardmeier , 2016 ; Isabelle et al. , 2017 b ; Burchardt et al. , 2017 ) .
The paper at hand describes the use of a test suite in order to evaluate 18 German to English and 18 English to German MT systems that participated at the Shared Task of the Sixth Conference on Machine Translation ( WMT21 ) 1 .
The evaluation is performed by an extensive test suite that tests a wide range of linguistically motivated phenomena .
In addition to our contributions in the previous years , which focused only on German to English , this year we are presenting for the first time results with an extensive test suite with a similar logic for the opposite direction English to German .
Our German to English test set contains 5,560 test sentences , covering 107 linguistic phenomena that are organized in 14 categories .
The English to German test set contains 4,443 test sentences , covering 111 linguistic phenomena that are organized in 12 categories .
Related Work
Test suites have already been used since the beginnings of MT in the 1990s ( King and Falkedal , 1990 ; Way , 1991 ; Heid and Hildenbrand , 1991 ) .
With the rise of deep learning , the quality of MT outputs has improved significantly , which in turn lead to a recent revival of test suites that focus on the evaluation of specific linguistic phenomena ( e.g. , pronoun translation ( Guillou and Hardmeier , 2016 ) , or on the comparison of different MT technologies ( Isabelle et al. , 2017a ; Burchardt et al. , 2017 ) , and Quality Estimation methods ( Avramidis et al. , 2018 ) .
Within the scope of the test suite track of the Conference on Machine Translation , several test suites for multiple language directions have Lexical Ambiguity Er las gerne Novellen .

These test suites focus on one or multiple different phenomena , such as conjunctions ( Popovi ? , 2019 ) , grammatical contrasts ( Cinkova and Bojar , 2018 ) , discourse ( Bojar et al. , 2018 ; Rysov ? et al. , 2019 ) , domain-specific translations ( Vojt?chov ?
et al. , 2019 ) , gender coreference ( Kocmi et al. , 2020 ) , markables ( Zouhar et al. , 2020 ) , morphology ( Burlot et al. , 2018 ) , pronouns ( Guillou et al. , 2018 ) , or word sense disambiguation ( Rios et al. , 2018 ; Raganato et al. , 2019 ; Scherrer et al. , 2020 ) .
In contrast to the majority of these test suites , our test suite does not focus on a single phenomenon but performs a systematic evaluation of more than one hundred phenomena per language direction .
Methods
Our test suite consists of two test sets ( one per language direction ) that have been created manually with the aim of testing the performance of MT systems .
They cover a wide variety of linguistic phenomena which are grouped in different categories .
While there is a big overlap between the linguistic categories and phenomena in the two test sets , there are also many differences as the categories and phenomena are language -specific .
Some exemplary test sentences can be seen in Table 1 .
2 Each linguistic phenomenon in the test suite is represented by multiple test sentences .
Each test sentence is tied to a number of rules that determine whether a translation of the sentence would be deemed correct or incorrect .
The performance of an MT system with regard to the linguistic phenomena is then evaluated by observing the amount of test sentences that are translated correctly .
Application of the test suite
The construction of the test suite has been described in detail in the papers for the test suite track from the previous years .
Figure 1 depicts the preparation and application of the test suite with steps a to c representing the construction .
The application starts with step d :
The test sentences are given as input to the MT systems .
The MT outputs are then evaluated by the set of rules which define whether the phenomenon under inspection is translated correctly or not ( step e ) .
The rules consist of regular expressions and fixed strings .
When the rules cannot be applied to a translation to automatically determine whether it is correct or incorrect , the test sentence is marked with a warning .
Those warnings are consequently inspected manually by a human annotator with linguistic knowledge who decides on the correctness of the translation and adapts the set of rules accordingly ( step e ) .
Thereafter , the phenomenon-specific translation accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of correctly translated test sentences of a phenomenon by the total number of test sentences of that phenomenon : accuracy = correct translations sum of test items
Since the aim of this evaluation is to compare the systems in a fair way , we include only the test items that do not contain any warnings for any of the systems in the calculation .
Test items that have an unresolved warning for at least one system are excluded from the calculation .
Unfortunately , this reduces the amount of the test items by removing properly validated ones , and this is where we see the importance of the extensive manual evaluation and the creation of rules with good coverage .
To define which systems perform better for a particular phenomenon ( or category ) , we compare all systems to the one with the highest accuracy .
When we compare the highest scoring system with the rest , we confirm the significance of the comparison with a one-tailed Z-test with ? = 0.95 .
The systems which do not differ significantly from the best system are considered to be in the first performance cluster and indicated with boldface in the tables .
The boldfaces therefore have a meaning only for the respective row of the compute the average percentages , category macroaverage computes the percentages independently for each category and then averages them ( i.e. treating all categories equally ) , and phenomenon macroaverage computes the percentages independently for each phenomenon and then takes the average ( i.e. treating all phenomena equally ) .
Experiment setup
In the evaluation presented in this paper , we obtained translations of our test suite by 36 systems that are part of the news translation task of the Sixth Conference on Machine Translation ( WMT21 ) .
In previous years , we solely applied our test suite to the German to English MT outputs .
However , this year , we did not only analyse the MT outputs from 18 German to English systems , but also from 18 English to German systems .
While there were already many rules for the evaluation of German to English MT output in our test suite , very few rules were available for the other language direction when we received the translations .
Therefore , a significantly bigger amount of manual work was involved in the evaluation this year .
For German to English there were on average 5.76 % of warnings when we received the translations , while for English to German there were on average 84.21 % of warnings .
The manual evaluation process was conducted by three annotators with linguistic knowledge over the course of seven weeks and involved around 80 person hours .
After the extensive manual evaluation , there were on average 3.04 % of warnings for German to English and 4.87 % for English to German .
As we explained previously , in order to have a fair comparison between the systems we excluded items where at least one system has an unresolved warning .
Therefore , in the results that we are presenting in this paper we can only use 3,806 out of the 5,560 ( 68.4 % ) test items for German to English and 3,096 out of the 4,443 ( 69.7 % ) test items for English to German for the systems comparison .
Results
The accuracies resulting from the application of the test suite on the system outputs can be seen in the tables in the Appendix .
We first present the results aggregated in categories ( Tables 4 and 5 ) so one can have a broad overview of the systems performance , whereas afterwards a yearly comparison with last years ( Table 6 ) and the detailed phenomenon-level results ( Tables 7 and 8 ) are shown .
The systems are ordered based on their macro- average accuracy , from high to low .

Comparison between systems For German to English , two systems have the highest category macro-averaged accuracy , Online -W and FacebookAI , whereas when considering the phenomenon macro-averaged accuracy , the significantly best systems are FacebookAI and Online -A. UEdin , Online -A and borderline compete with the best systems when the micro-average is considered , mainly because of their good accuracies on phenomena related to verb tense / aspect / mood , where there are many individual phenomena with a lot of test items in one category .
Overall , the average accuracies are very high , with the lowest system ( happyface ) having a micro-average of 72.3 % .
Despite the high accuracies there is definitely room for improvement .
For English to German , based on the category macro-average , FacebookAI and VolcTransAT share the first position .
Based on the micro-average and the phenomenon macro-average however , Face-bookAI , Online -B and VolcTrans - GLAT share the first position .
The accuracies for this language direction in overall are much higher on the microaverage , but not on the macro-average .
However , due to the fact that the test items are different in their nature and in the amount , we cannot make a direct comparison between the two language directions .
Categories
For some categories , the accuracies have reached very high numbers , which is the case for negation and punctuation , both having a 100 % for German to English .
Concerning punctuation , in the previous years we had seen individual systems with considerable punctuation errors , which seem to not appear this year .
However , the high scores do not necessarily mean that all problems for these phenomena are solved .
It could rather mean that our test suite does not cover the current edge cases , a consideration that is subject to further research .
Other categories such as composition , subordination and named entities & terminology reach an average of more than 90 % accuracy in German to English .
The worst performing category in German to English is false friends , where all systems perform 64 - 86 % .
Ambiguity , verb tense / aspect / mood and multi-word expressions ( MWE ) also perform relatively low , with accuracies less than 85 % .
For English to German , there are no categories for which all systems reach an accuracy of 100 % .
However , there are several categories with average accuracies above 95 % , that is function words , negation , verb tense / aspect / mood , and subordination .
The category with the lowest average is coordination & ellipsis , with an average accuracy of only 70.8 % .
The individual systems reach a wide range of 58.6 % to 81.6 % accuracy for this category while for most other systems , the range is not as big for the systems .
There are two more categories with a relatively low accuracy on average ( below 85 % ) , namely verb valency ( 81.4 % accuracy ) and ambiguity ( 83.3 % accuracy ) .
Phenomena For German to English , the most difficult phenomena this year remain the modal pluperfect ( negated and non-negated ) , the resultative predicates and the idioms .
Online -W does impressively well with idioms , achieving almost 60 % , with another two systems , FacebookAI and Online -A , reaching 33.3 % .
These numbers were significantly lower in the previous years , which indicates an improvement in this direction .
There are some phenomena for which all systems reached 100 % accuracy , such as negation , internal possessor , comma , ditransitive perfect , and intransitive future I .
Table 2 contains translation examples from linguistic phenomena with the lowest accuracy for German to English .
Idioms are types of multiword expressions .
The meaning of an idiom goes beyond the meanings of its individual elements .
Most idioms are very language -specific and therefore difficult to translate .
For the German idiom " um den hei?en Brei herumreden " , there is the equivalent English idiom " to beat about the bush " .
The first incorrect translation contains a direct translation of all the individual elements of the German idiom .
The second incorrect translation , which was produced by several MT systems , is very interesting because it does indeed contain the " bush " of the English idiom .
However , it still contains the wrong verb as the verb " is talking " is simply a translation of the German " redet " .
Therefore , the second translation is still incorrect .
Only the third translation which contains the full English idiom is correct .
The second example contains a test sentence from the phenomenon modal pluperfect .
Modal verbs can usually have several meanings which often leads to translation errors .
Furthermore , the tense pluperfect is often mistranslated as preterite , as in the first incorrect translation .
The second in - correct translation additionally leaves out the German modal verb " wollen " ( " to want " ) which completely changes the meaning of the translation .
Resultative predicates contain a verb and an adjective which describes the result of the verb action .
Resultative predicates do not exist that way in English , which makes them hard to translate .
In the example at hand , the meaning of the German sentence is that Lena drove the car which resulted in the car being broken .
A literal translation like in the first translation is ungrammatical .
The second and third translation are possible correct translations - even though the " driving " part is left out , these translations are still deemed best options to translate this phenomenon .
In English to German , idioms show even more difficulties as in German to English ( average accuracy only 14.6 % , the lowest average accuracy on any phenomenon for this language direction ) .
Here , 9 systems totally fail to translate any idiom , whereas the system with the highest accuracy is an unconstrained system , which may attributed to the fact that additional data led to better coverage of such cases .
Furthermore , middle voice ( 45.9 % ) , pseudogapping ( 60.5 % ) , and stripping ( 57.0 % ) and also have a relatively low accuracy .
On the other hand , there were also many phenomena which reached ( nearly ) 100 % accuracy , such as internal possessor , comma , indirect speech , infinitive clause , object clause , subject clause , passive voice , and ditransitive , intransitive and transitive verbs in many tenses .
Table 3 covers example translation from low ac-curacy phenomena for English to German .
The first example again contains an idiom .
The English idiom " to spill the beans " does not have an equivalent idiomatic translation in German .
Therefore , the first translation , which is a literal translation of the separate idiom elements , is incorrect .
The second and third translation are possible correct translations .
The second example sentence is taken from the phenomenon pseudogapping .
Put simply , in pseudogapping , part of the verb phrase is omitted .
In the example at hand , the non-finite verb part " like " is omitted in the second conjunct of the construction .
In the first incorrect German translation , the verb has been completely left out in the second conjunct ( while the subject " sie " persists ) .
In the second incorrect translation , the second conjunct contains the auxiliary verb ' ? st " which also leads to ungrammaticality .
The third translation leaves out the non-finite verb part " like " as well as the subject which results in a grammatical German construction .
The third example contains a sentence in middle voice .
In middle voice , the subject of the verb is neither agent nor patient .
A sentence in active voice would be : " I am driving the car . " , with the subject ( " I " ) being the agent .
A sentence in passive voice would be : " The car is driven by me . " with the subject ( " the car " ) being the patient .
The subject of the example sentence in Table 3 ( " This car " ) is neither agent nor patient .
As middle voice does not exist in German , such sentences have to be translated in other constructions .
A literal translation like the first example translation is incorrect .
Possible correct translations can be seen in the second and third translation .
Comparison with previous years
The progress of the systems performance through the last four years for German- English can be seen in Table 6 .
The calculation is done based on the common test items without warnings over all these years ( 4,366 test items ) , this is why the scores differ slightly from the ones in Table 4 .
In the first columns of Table 6 the best systems of every year are compared .
One can see that the best system of 2021 has significantly better macro- averaged accuracy as compared to the best system of 2020 , but when the micro-averaged accuracy is considered , there has been no significant improvement or deterioration .
This year 's best system also seems to perform better in a few categories , with most impressive improvements at false friends ( + 14 % ) and the non-verbal agreement ( + 5 % ) .
Individual systems show some small improvements in general , but the fine- grained evaluation is able to indicate some significant deterioration in particular categories .
For example , Online-B , Online -G and VolcTrans , despite their overall improvement , show a significant deterioration regarding verb tense / aspect / mood , which reaches a - 9 % in the case of VolcTrans .
Other deteriorations occur for several systems regarding false friends and function words .
This shows that the overall improvement in translation quality may occur at the expense of particular qualitative aspects .
Conclusions and Further Work
We presented the result of applying a fine- grained linguistically motivated test suite on the outputs of 36 state - of - the - art machine translation systems , as submitted in the Sixth Conference on Machine Translation .
We presented detailed accuracies of translations of 18 German to English as well as 18 English to German MT systems based on more than 3,000 test items each , organized in various linguistic categories and fine- grained phenomena .
Additionally , we drew a comparison to previous years ' evaluations .
In both language directions , the systems achieve good accuracies in most phenomena or categories and there is some advancement as compared to last year , although there is space for about 10 % improvement on the average accuracy .
A few phenomena still suffer considerably , such as the idioms , the modal pluperfect and the German resultative predicates , although there is notable improvement as compared to previous years .
As discussed , the very high accuracies for some categories or phenomena raise the question whether the difficulty of the respective test items should be increased .
