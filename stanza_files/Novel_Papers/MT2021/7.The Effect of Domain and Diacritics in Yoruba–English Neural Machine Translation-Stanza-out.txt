The Effect of Domain and Diacritics in Yor ùbá-English Neural Machine Translation
abstract
Massively multilingual machine translation ( MT ) has shown impressive capabilities , including zero and few-shot translation between low-resource language pairs .
However , these models are often evaluated on high- resource languages with the assumption that they generalize to low-resource ones .
The difficulty of evaluating MT models on low-resource pairs is often due to lack of standardized evaluation datasets .
In this paper , we present MENYO - 20k , the first multi-domain parallel corpus with a special focus on clean orthography for Yor ?b?- English with standardized train-test splits for benchmarking .
We provide several neural MT benchmarks and compare them to the performance of popular pre-trained ( massively multilingual ) MT models both for the heterogeneous test set and its subdomains .
Since these pre-trained models use huge amounts of data with uncertain quality , we also analyze the effect of diacritics , a major characteristic of Yor ?b? , in the training data .
We investigate how and when this training condition affects the final quality and intelligibility of a translation .
Our models outperform massively multilingual models such as Google ( + 8.7 BLEU ) and Facebook M2M ( + 9.1 BLEU ) when translating to Yor?b? , setting a high quality benchmark for future research .
Introduction Neural machine translation ( NMT ) achieves high quality performance when large amounts of parallel sentences are available ( Barrault et al. , 2020 ) .
Large and freely - available parallel corpora do exist for a small number of high- resource pairs and domains .
However , for low-resource languages such as Yor ?b? ( yo ) , one can only find few thousands of parallel sentences online 1 .
In the best- case scenario , i.e. some amount of parallel data exists , one can use the Biblethe Bible is the most available resource for low-resource languages ( Resnik et al. , 1999 ) - and JW300 ( Agi? and Vuli ? , 2019 ) .
Notice that both corpora belong to the religious domain and they do not generalize well to popular domains such as news and daily conversations .
In this paper , we address this problem for the Yor ?b?- English ( yo-en ) language pair by creating a multi-domain parallel dataset , MENYO - 20k , which we make publicly available 2 with CC BY - NC 4.0 licence .
It is a heterogeneous dataset that comprises texts obtained from news articles , TED talks , movie and radio transcripts , science and technology texts , and other short articles curated from the web and translated by professional translators .
Based on the resulting train- development - test split , we provide a benchmark for the yo-en translation task for future research on this language pair .
This allows us to properly evaluate the generalization of MT models trained on JW300 and the Bible on new domains .
We further explore transfer learning approaches that can make use of a few thousand sentence pairs for domain adaptation .
Finally , we analyze the effect of Yor ?b? diacritics on the translation quality of pre-trained MT models , discussing in details how this affects the understanding of the translated text especially in the en-yo direction .
We show the benefit of automatic diacritic restoration in addressing the problem of noisy diacritics .
The Yor ?b? Language
The Yor ?b? language is the third most spoken language in Africa , and it is native to southwestern Nigeria and the Republic of Benin .
It is one of the national languages in Nigeria , Benin and Togo , and spoken across the West African regions .
The language belongs to the Niger - Congo family , and it is spoken by over 40 million native speakers ( Eberhard et al. , 2019 ) . Yor ?b? has 25 letters without the Latin characters c , q , v , x and z , and with additional characters e . , gb , s . , o . . Yor ?b? is a tonal language with three tones : low , middle and high .
These tones are represented by the grave ( e.g. " ? " ) , optional macron ( e.g. " ? " ) and acute ( e.g. " ? " ) accents respectively .
These tones are applied on vowels and syllabic nasals , but the mid tone is usually ignored in writings .
The tone information and underdots are important for the correct pronunciation of words .
Often , articles written online , including news articles such as BBC 3 ignore diacritics .
Ignoring diacritics makes it difficult to identify or pronounce words except when they are embedded in context .
For example , ?d? ( language ) , ed? ( crayfish ) , e . de . ( a town in Nigeria ) , ? . de . ( trap ) and ? . d? . ( balcony ) will be mapped to ede without diacritics .
Machine translation might be able to learn to disambiguate the meaning of words and generate correct English even with un-diacriticized Yor ?b?.
However , one cannot generate correct Yor ?b? if the training data is un-diacriticized .
One of the purposes of our work is to build a corpus with correct and complete diacritization in several domains .
MENYO -20 k
The dataset collection was motivated by the inability of machine translation models trained on JW300 to generalize to new domains ( ? et al. , ) .
Although ?
et al. ( 2020 for Yor ?b? with surprisingly high BLEU scores , the evaluation was done on very few examples from the COVID-19 and TED Talks domains with 39 and 80 sentences respectively .
Inspired by the FLoRes dataset for Nepali and Sinhala ( Guzm ? n et al. , 2019 ) , we create a high quality test set for Yor ?b?- English with few thousands of sentences in different domains to check the quality of industry MT models , pre-trained MT models , and MT models based on popular corpora such as JW300 and the Bible .
Dataset Collection for MENYO -20k
Table 1 summarizes the texts collected , their source , the original language of the texts and the number of sentences from each source .
We collected both parallel corpora freely available on the web ( e.g JW News ) and monolingual corpora we are interested in translating ( e.g. the TED talks ) to build the MENYO - 20 k corpus .
The JW News is different from the JW300 since they contain only news reports , and we manually verified that they are not in JW300 .
Some few sentences were donated by professional translators such as " short texts " in Table 1 .
Our curation followed two steps : ( 1 ) translation of monolingual texts crawled from the web by professional translators ; ( 2 ) verification of translation , orthography and diacritics for parallel texts obtained online and translated .
Texts obtained from the web that were judged by native speakers being high quality were verified once , the others were verified twice .
The verification of translation and diacritics was done by professional translators and volunteers who are native speakers .
Table 1 on the right ( top ) summarizes the figures for the MENYO - 20 k dataset with 20,100 parallel sentences split into 10,070 training sentences , 3,397 development sentences , and 6,633 test sentences .
The test split contains 6 domains , 3 of them have more than 1000 sentences and can be used as domain test sets by themselves .
Other Corpora for Yor ?b? and English Parallel corpora
For our experiments , we use two widely available parallel corpora from the religion domain , Bible and JW300 ( Table 1 , bottom ) .
The parallel version of the Bible is not available , so we align the verses from the New International Version ( NIV ) for English and the Bible Society of Nigeria version ( BSN ) for Yor ?b?.
After aligning the verses , we obtain 30,760 parallel sentences .
Also , we download the JW300 parallel corpus which is available for a large variety of low-resource language pairs .
It has parallel corpora from English to 343 languages containing religion - related texts .
From the JW300 corpus , we get 459 , 871 sentence pairs already tokenized with Polyglot 4 ( Al - Rfou , 2015 ) .
Monolingual Corpora
We make use of additional monolingual data to train the semisupervised MT model using back - translation .
The Yor ?b? monolingual texts are from the Yor ?b? embedding corpus ( Alabi et al. , 2020 ) , one additional book ( " Ojowu " ) with permission from the author , JW300 - yo , and Bible -yo .
We only use Yor ?b? texts that are properly diacritized .
In order to keep the topics in the Yor?b? and English monolingual corpora close , we choose two Nigerian news websites ( The Punch Newspaper 5 and Voice of Nigeria 6 ) for the English monolingual corpus .
The news scraped covered categories such as politics , business , sports and entertainment .
Overall , we gather 475,763 monolingual sentences from the website .
Dataset Domain Analysis MENYO - 20 k is , on purpose , highly heterogeneous .
In this section we analyze the differences and how its ( sub ) domains depart from the characteristics of the commonly used Yor ?b?- English corpora for MT .
Characterizing the domain of a dataset is a difficult task .
Some metrics previously used need either large corpora or a characteristic vocabulary of the domain ( Beyer et al. , 2020 ; Espa?a- Bonet et al. , 2020 ) .
Here , we do not have these resources and we report the overlapping vocabulary between training and test sets and the perplexity observed in the test sets when a language model ( LM ) is trained on the MT training corpora .
In order to estimate the perplexities , we train a language model of order 5 with KenLM ( Heafield , 2011 ) on each of the 3 training data subsets : JW300 ( named C2 for short in tables ) , JW300 + Bible ( C3 ) , . Following NMT standard processing pipelines ( see subsection 4.2 ) , we perform byte-pair encoding ( BPE ) ( Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) on the corpora to avoid a large number of out - of- vocabulary tokens which , for small corpora , could alter the LM probabilities .
For each of the resulting language models , we evaluate their average perplexity on the different domains of the test set to evaluate compositional domain differences ( Figure 1 , top ) .
As expected , the average perplexity drops when adding more training data .
Due to the limited domain of both JW300 and Bible , a literary style close to the Books domain , the decrease in perplexity is small when adding additional Bible data to JW300 , namely ?8 % ( en ) and ?11 % ( yo ) .
Interestingly , both JW300 and Bible also seem to be close to the TED domain ( 1st and 2nd lowest perplexities for en and yo respectively ) , which may be due to discourse / monologue content in both training corpora .
Adding the domain-diverse MENYO - 20 k corpus largely decreases the perplexity across all domains with a major decrease of ?66 % on IT ( yo ) and smallest decrease of ?1 % on Books ( en ) .
The perplexity scores correlate negatively with the resulting BLEU scores in Table 3 , with a Pearson 's r ( r ) of ?0.367 ( en ) and ?0.461 ( yo ) , underlining that compositional domain differences between training and test subsets is the main factor of differences in translation quality .
Further , to evaluate lexical domain differences , we calculate the vocabulary coverage ( tokenized , not byte- pair encoded 7 ) of the different domains of the test set by each of the training subsets ( Figure 1 , bottom ) .
The vocabulary coverage increases to a large extend when MENYO - 20 k is added .
However , while vocabulary coverage and average perplexities have a strong ( negative ) correlation , r = ?0.756 ( en ) and r = ?0.689 ( yo ) , a high perplexity does not necessarily mean low vocabulary coverage .
E.g. , the vocabulary coverage of the IT domain by JW300 is high ( 91 % for en ) despite leading to high perplexities ( 765 for en ) .
In general , vocabulary coverage of the test sets is less indicative of the resulting translation performance than perplexity , showing only a weak correlation between vocabulary coverage and BLEU , with r = 0.150 and r = 0.281 for en and yo respectively .
4 Neural Machine Translation for Yor ?b?- English 4.1 Systems Supervised NMT
We use the transformer - base architecture proposed by Vaswani et al . ( 2017 ) as implemented in Fairseq 8 ( Ott et al. , 2019 ) .
We set the drop-out at 0.3 and batch size at 10 , 240 tokens .
For optimization , we use adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with ?
1 = 0.9 and ? 2 = 0.98 and a learning rate of 0.0005 .
The learning rate has a warmup update of 4000 , using label smoothed cross-entropy loss function with label - smoothing value of 0.1 .
Semi-supervision via iterative back- translation
We use the best performing supervised system to translate the monolingual corpora described in section 3 yielding to 476 k backtranslations .
This data is used together with the original corpus to train a new system .
The process is repeated until convergence .
Fine-tuning mT5
We examine a transfer learning approach by fine-tuning a massively multilingual model mT5 ( Xue et al. , 2021 ) . mT5 had been pre-trained on 6.3T tokens originating from Common Crawl in 101 languages ( including Yor ?b? ) .
The approach has already shown competitive results on other languages ( Tang et al. , 2020 ) .
In our experiments , we use mT5 - base , a model with 580M parameters .
We transferred all the parameters of the model including the sub-word vocabulary .
Publicly Available NMT Models
We further evaluate the performance of three multilingual NMT systems : OPUS - MT ( Tiedemann and Thottingal , 2020 ) , Google Multilingual NMT ( GM - NMT ) ( Arivazhagan et al. , 2019 ) and Facebook 's M2M -100 ( Fan et al. , 2020 ) with 1.2B parameters .
All the three pre-trained models are trained on over 100 languages .
While GMNMT and M2M - 100 are a single multilingual model , OPUS - MT models are for each translation direction , e.g yo-en .
We generate the translations of the test set using the Google Translate interface , 9 and OPUS - MT using Easy - NMT .
10 For M2M -100 , we make use of Fairseq to translate the test set .
Experimental Settings Data and Preprocessing For the MT experiments , we use the training part of our MENYO - 20 k corpus and two other parallel corpora , Bible and JW300 ( section 3 ) .
For tuning the hyperparameters , we use the development split of the multi-domain data which has 3 , 397 sentence pairs and for testing the test split with 6 , 633 parallel sentences .
To ensure that all the parallel corpora are in the same format , we convert the Yor ?b? texts in the JW300 dataset to Unicode Normalization Form Composition ( NFC ) , the format of the Yor ?b? texts in the Bible and multidomain dataset .
Our preprocessing pipeline includes punctuation normalization , tokenization , and truecasing .
For punctuation normalization and truecasing , we use the Moses toolkit ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) while for tokenization , we use Polyglot , since it is the tokenizer used in JW300 .
We apply joint BPE , with a vocabulary threshold of 20 and 40 k merge operations .
Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the models , we use tokenized BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) score implemented in multi-bleu.perl and confidence intervals ( p = 95 % ) in the scoring package 11 . Since diacritics are applied on individual characters , we also use chrF , a character n-gram F1 -score ( Popovi ? , 2015 ) , for en-yo translations .
Automatic Diacritization
In order to automatically diacritize Google MNMT and M2M - 100 outputs for comparison , we train an automatic diacritization system using the supervised NMT setup .
We use the Yor?b? side of MENYO - 20k and JW300 , which use consistent diacritization .
We split the resulting corpus into train ( 458 k sentences ) , test ( 517 sentences ) and development ( 500 sentences ) portions .
We apply a small BPE of 2 k merge operations to the data .
We apply noise on the diacritics by i ) randomly removing a diacritic with probability p = 0.3 and ii ) randomly replacing a diacritic with p = 0.3 .
The corrupted version of the corpus is used as the source data , and the NMT model is trained to reconstruct the original diacritics .
On the test set , where the corrupted source has a BLEU ( precision ) of 19.0 ( 29.8 ) , reconstructing the diacritics using our system lead to a BLEU ( precision ) of 87.0 ( 97.1 ) , thus a major increase of + 68.0 ( + 67.3 ) respectively .
Automatic Evaluation Internal Comparison
We train four basic NMT engines on different subsets of the training data : Bible ( C1 ) , JW300 ( C2 ) , JW300 + Bible ( C3 ) and JW300 + Bible + MENYO -20 k ( C4 ) .
Further , we analyse the effect of fine-tuning for in-domain translation .
For this , we fine - tune the converged model trained on JW300 + Bible on MENYO - 20 k ( C3 + Transfer ) and , similarly , we fine - tune the converged model trained on JW300 + Bible + MENYO - 20 k on .
This yields six NMT models in total for en-yo and yo-en each .
Their transla - 3 . As expected , the BLEU scores obtained after training on Bible only ( C1 ) are low , with BLEU 2.2 and 1.4 for en-yo and yo-en respectively , which is due to its small amount of training data .
Training on the larger JW300 corpus ( C2 ) leads to higher scores of BLEU 7.5 ( en-yo ) and 9.6 ( yo-en ) , while combining it with Bible ( C3 ) only leads to a small increase of BLEU +0.6 and + 1.2 for en-yo and yo-en respectively .
When further adding MENYO - 20 k ( C4 ) to the training data , the translation quality increases by + 2.8 ( en-yo ) and + 3.2 ( yo-en ) .
When , instead of adding MENYO - 20k to the training pool , it is used to fine - tune the converged JW300 + Bible model , ( C3 + Transfer ) the increase in BLEU over JW300 + Bible is even larger for en-yo ( BLEU + 4.2 ) , which results in an overall top-scoring model with BLEU 12.3 .
For yo-en fine-tuning is slightly less effective ( BLEU 13.2 ) than simply adding MENYO - 20k to the training data ( BLEU 14.0 ) .
As seen in subsection 3.3 , perplexities and vocabulary coverage in English are not as distant among training / test sets as in Yor ?b? , so the fine-tuning step resulted less efficient .
When we use the MENYO - 20k dataset to fine- tune the converged JW300 + Bible + MENYO - 20 k model ( C4 + Transfer ) we observe an increase in BLEU over JW300 + Bible for both translation directions : + 4.3 for en-yo and + 3.8 for yo-en .
This is the best performing system and the one we use for back - translation .
Table 2 also shows the performance of the semi-supervised system ( C4 + Transfer + BT ) .
After two iterations of BT , we obtain an improvement of + 3.6 BLEU points on yo-en .
There is , however , no improvement in the en-yo direction probably because a significant portion of our monolingual data is based on JW300 .
Finally , fine-tuning mT5 with MENYO - 20 k does not improve over fine-tuning only the JW300 + Bible system on en-yo , but it does for yo-en .
Again , multilingual systems are stronger when used for English , and we need the contribution of back -translation to outperform the generic mT5 .
External Comparison
We evaluate the performance of the open source multilingual engines introduced in the previous section on the full test set ( Table 2 , bottom ) .
OPUS - MT , while having no model available for en-yo , achieves a BLEU of 5.9 for yo-en .
Thus , despite being trained on JW300 and other available yo-en corpora on OPUS , it is largely outperformed by our NMT model trained on JW300 only ( BLEU + 3.7 ) .
This may be caused by some of the noisy corpora included in OPUS ( like CCaligned ) , which can depreciate the translation quality .
Facebook 's M2M -100 , is also largely outperformed even by our simple JW300 baseline by 5 BLEU points in both translation directions .
A manual examination of the en-yo LASER extractions used to train M2M - 100 shows that these are very noisy similar to the findings of Caswell et al . ( 2021 ) , which explains the poor translation performance .
Google , on the other hand , obtains impressive results with GMNMT for the yo-en direction , with BLEU 22.4 .
The opposite direction en-yo , however , shows a significantly lower performance ( BLEU 3.7 ) , being outperformed even by our simple JW300 baseline ( BLEU + 3.8 ) .
The difference in performance for English can be attributed to the highly multilingual but English-centric nature of the Google MNMT model .
As already noticed by Arivazhagan et al . ( 2019 ) , low-resourced language pairs benefit from multilinguality when translated into English , but improvements are minor when translating into the non-English language .
For the other translation direction , en-yo , we notice that lots of diacritics are lost in Google translations , damaging the BLEU scores .
Whether this drop in BLEU scores really affects understanding or not is analyzed via a human evaluation ( Section 4.4 ) .
Diacritization Diacritics are important for Yor ?b? embeddings ( Alabi et al. , 2020 ) .
However , they are often ignored in popular multilingual models ( e.g. multilingual BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) ) , and not consistently available in training corpora and even test sets .
In order to investigate whether the diacritics in Yor ?b?
MT can help to disambiguate translation choices , we additionally train yo-en u equivalent models on undiacritized JW300 , JW300 + Bible and JW300 + Bible + MENYO - 20 k ( Table 2 , indicated as yo-en u in comparison to the ones with diacritics yo-en ) .
Since one cannot generate correct Yor ?b? text when training without diacritics , en- yo u systems are not trained .
Alternatively , we restore diacritics using our in- house diacritizer in the output of open source models that produce undiacritized text .
Results for yo-en are not conclusive .
Diacritization is useful when only out - of- domain data is used in training ( JW300 , JW300 + Bible 12 for testing on MENYO - 20k ) .
In this case , the domain of the training data is very different from the domain of the test set , and disambiguation is needed not to bias all the lexicon towards the religious domain .
When we include in- domain data ( JW300 + Bible + MENYO - 20 k ) , both models perform equally well , with BLEU 14.0 for both diacritized and undiacritized versions .
Diacritization is not needed when we fine - tune the model with data that shares the domain with the test set ( JW300 + Bible + Transfer ) , BLEU is 13.2 for the diacritized version vs.
BLEU 13.9 for the undiacritized one .
In practice , this means that , when training data is far from the desired domain , investing work for a clean diacritized Yor ?b? source input can help improve the translation performance .
When more data is present , the diacritization becomes less important , since context is enough for disambiguation .
When Yor ?b? is the target language , diacritization is always needed .
An example is the low automatic scores GMNMT ( BLEU 3.7 , chrF 18.5 ) and M2M -100 ( BLEU 3.3 , chrF 15.8 ) reach for en-yo translation .
Table 2 - bottom ( indicated as en-yo p ) show the improvements after automatically restoring the diacritics , namely BLEU + 6.9 points , chrF + 15.9 for GMNMT ; and + 3.5 and + 9.9 for M2M - 100 .
Even if the diacritizer is not perfect , diacritics do not seem enough to get state - of - the - art results according to automatic metrics : fine -tuning with high quality data ( C4 + Transfer + BT , chrF 34.6 ) is still better than using huge but unadapted systems .
Domain Differences
In order to analyze the domain-specific performance of the different NMT models , we evaluate each model on the different domain subsets of the test set ( Table 3 ) .
The Proverb subset is especially difficult in both directions , as it shows the lowest translation performance across all domains , i.e. maximum BLEU of 9.04 ( en-yo ) and 8.74 ( yo-en ) .
This is due to the fact that proverbs often do not have literal counterparts in the target language , thus making them especially difficult to translate .
The TED domain is the best performing test domain , with maximum BLEU of 16.1 ( en-yo ) and 16.8 ( yo-en ) .
This can be attributed to the decent base coverage of the TED domain by JW300 and Bible together ( monologues ) with the additional TED domain data included in the MENYO - 20 k training split ( 507 sentence pairs ) .
Also , most BLEU results are on line with the LM perplexity results and conclusions drawn in subsection 3.3 .
Due to the closeness of Bible and JW300 to the book domain , we see only small improvements of BLEU on this domain , i.e. + 0.2 ( en-yo ) and + 0.7 ( yo-en ) , when adding MENYO - 20 k ( C4 ) to the JW300 + Bible ( C3 ) training data pool .
On the other hand , the IT domain benefits the most from the additional MENYO - 20 k data , with major gains of BLEU + 5.5 ( en-yo ) and 4.6 ( yo-en ) , owing to the introduction of IT domain content in the MENYO - 20 k training data ( ?
1 k sentence pairs ) , which is completely lacking in JW300 and Bible .
Human Evaluation
To have a better understanding of the quality of the translation models and the intelligibility of the translations , we compare three top performing models in en-yo and yo-en .
For en-yo , we use C4 + Transfer , C4 + Transfer +BT and GMNMT .
Although GMNMT is not the third best system according to BLEU ( Table 2 ) , we are interested in the study of diacritics in translation quality and intelligibility .
For the yo-en , we choose C4 + Transfer + BT , mT5 + Transfer and GMNMT being the 3 models with the highest BLEU scores on Table 2 .
We ask 7 native speakers of Yor ?b? that are fluent in English to rate the adequacy , fluency and diacritic accuracy in a subset of test sentences .
Four of them rated the en-yo translation direction and the others rated the opposite direction yo-en .
We randomly select 100 sentences within the outputs of the six systems and duplicate 5 of them to check the intra-agreement consistency of our raters .
Each annotator is then asked to rate 105 sentences per system on a 1 ? 5 Likert scale for each of the features ( for English , diacritic accuracy cannot be evaluated ) .
We calculate the agreement among raters using Krippendorff 's ?.
The inter-agreement per task is 0.44 ( adequacy ) , 0.40 ( fluency ) and 0.87 ( diacritics ) for Yor?b? , and 0.71 ( adequacy ) , 0.55 ( fluency ) for English language .
We observe that a lot of raters often rate the fluency score for many sentences with the same values ( e.g 4 or 5 ) , which results to a lower Krippendorff 's ? for fluency .
The intra-agreement for the four Yor ?b? raters are 0.75 , 0.91 , 0.66 , and 0.87 , while the intra-agreement for the three English raters across all evaluation tasks are 0.92 , 0.71 , and 0.81 .
For yo-en , our evaluators rated on average GMNMT to be the best in terms of adequacy ( 4.02 out of 5 ) and fluency ( 4.71 ) , followed by mT5 + Transfer , which shows that finetuning massively multilingual models also benefits low resource languages MT especially in terms of fluency ( 4.39 ) .
This contradicts the results of the automatic evaluation which prefers C4 + Transfer + BT over mT5 + Transfer .
For en-yo , GMNMT is still the best in terms of adequacy ( 3.69 ) followed by C4 + Transfer + BT , but performs the worst in terms of fluency and diacritics prediction accuracy .
So , the bad quality of the diacritics affects fluency and drastically penalises automatic metrics such as BLEU , but does not interfere with the intelligibility of the translations as shown by the good average adequacy rating .
Automatic diacritic restoration for Yor ?b?
( Orife , 2018 ; Orife et al. , 2020 ) can therefore be very useful to improve translation quality .
C4 + Transfer and C4 + Transfer + BT perform similarly with high scores in terms of fluency and near perfect score in diacritics prediction accuracy ( 4.91 ? 0.1 ) as a result of being trained on cleaned corpora .
Related Work
In order to make MT available for a broader range of linguistic communities , recent years have seen an effort in creating new parallel corpora for low-resource language pairs .
Recently , Guzm ?n et al. ( 2019 ) provided novel supervised , semi-supervised and unsupervised benchmarks for Indo-Aryan languages { Sinhala , Nepali} - English on an evaluation set of professionally translated sentences sourced from the Sinhala , Nepali and English Wikipedias .
Novel parallel corpora focusing on African languages cover South African languages ( { Afrikaans , isiZulu , Northern Sotho , Setswana , Xitsonga} - English ) ( Groenewald and Fourie , 2009 ) with MT benchmarks evaluated in Martinus and Abbott ( 2019 ) , as well as multidomain ( News , Wikipedia , Twitter , Conversational ) Amharic-English ( Hadgu et al. , 2020 ) and multidomain ( Government , Wikipedia , News etc. ) Igbo-English ( Ezeani et al. , 2020 ) .
Further , the LORELEI project ( Strassel and Tracey , 2016 ) has created parallel corpora for a variety of lowresource language pairs , including a number of Niger -Congo languages such as { isiZulu , Twi , Wolof , Yor ?b?
}- English .
However , these are not open-access .
On the contrary , Masakhane ( ? et al. , 2020 ) is an ongoing participatory project focusing on creating new freely - available parallel corpora and MT benchmark models for a large variety of African languages .
While creating parallel resources for low-resource language pairs is one approach to increase the number of linguistic communities covered by MT , this does not scale to the sheer amount of possible language combinations .
Another research line focuses on low-resource MT from the modeling side , developing methods which allow a MT system to learn the translation task with smaller amounts of supervisory signals .
This is done by exploiting the weaker supervisory signals in larger amounts of available monolingual data , e.g. by identifying additional parallel data in monolingual corpora ( Artetxe and Schwenk , 2019 ; Schwenk et al. , 2021
Schwenk et al. , , 2020 , comparable corpora ( Ruiter et al. , 2019 ( Ruiter et al. , , 2021 , or by including auto-encoding ( Currey et al. , 2017 ) or language modeling tasks ( Gulcehre et al. , 2015 ; Ramachandran et al. , 2017 ) during training .
Low - resource language pairs can benefit from high- resource languages through transfer learning ( Zoph et al. , 2016 ) , e.g. in a zero-shot setting ( Johnson et al. , 2017 ) , by using pre-trained language models ( Lample and Conneau , 2019 ) , or finding an optimal path of pivoting through related languages ( Leng et al. , 2019 ) .
By adapting the model hyperparameters to the low-resource scenario , Sennrich and Zhang ( 2019 ) were able to achieve impressive improvements over a standard NMT system .
Conclusion
We present MENYO - 20k , a novel en-yo multi-domain parallel corpus for machine translation and domain adaptation .
By defining a standardized train- development - test split of this corpus , we provide several NMT benchmarks for future research on the en-yo MT task .
Further , we analyze the domain differences on the MENYO - 20 k corpus and the translation performance of NMT models trained on religion corpora , such as JW300 and Bible , across the different domains .
We show that , despite consisting of only 10 k parallel sentences , adding the MENYO - 20 k corpus train split to JW300 and Bible largely improves the translation performance over all domains .
Further , we train a variety of supervised , semi-supervised and fine- tuned MT benchmarks on available en-yo corpora , creating a high quality baseline that outperforms current massively multilingual models , e.g. Google MNMT by BLEU + 18.8 ( en-yo ) .
This shows the positive impact of using smaller amounts of high-quality data ( e.g. C4 + Transfer , BLEU 12.4 ) that takes into account language -specific characteristics , i.e. diacritics , over massive amounts of noisy data ( Facebook M2M -100 , BLEU 3.3 ) .
Apart from having low BLEU scores , our human evaluation reveals that models trained on low-quality diacritics ( Google MNMT ) suffer especially in fluency , while still being intelligible to the reader .
While correctly diacritized data is vital for translating en-yo , it only has an impact on the quality of yo-en translation quality when there is a domain mismatch between training and testing data .
