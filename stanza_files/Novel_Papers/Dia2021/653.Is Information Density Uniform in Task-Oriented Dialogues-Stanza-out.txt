Is Information Density Uniform in Task- Oriented Dialogues ?
abstract
The Uniform Information Density principle states that speakers plan their utterances to reduce fluctuations in the density of the information transmitted .
In this paper , we test whether , and within which contextual units this principle holds in task - oriented dialogues .
We show that there is evidence supporting the principle in written dialogues where participants play a cooperative reference game as well as in spoken dialogues involving instruction giving and following .
Our study underlines the importance of identifying the relevant contextual components , showing that information content increases particularly within topically and referentially related contextual units .
Introduction
Due to production and perception errors , differences between individuals , and other sources of uncertainty , language use for information transmission can be thought to happen through a noisy channel .
Effective and efficient information exchange under such conditions can be modelled using the tools of Information Theory ( Shannon , 1948 ) .
Indeed , information - theoretic models have successfully accounted for surprisal in speech perception ( Jelinek et al. , 1975 ; Clayards et al. , 2008 ) , reading ( Keller , 2004 ; Demberg and Keller , 2008 ; Levy et al. , 2009 ) , and sentence interpretation ( Levy , 2008 ; Gibson et al. , 2013 ) , providing psycholinguistic evidence that the information content of linguistic signals is related to comprehension processing effort .
Speakers , too , are sensitive to the properties of the communication channel .
They are thought to simultaneously minimise their own production effort and the addressee 's processing effort ( Clark and Wilkes - Gibbs , 1986 ; Clark and Schaefer , 1989 ) .
The most efficient way of dealing with both pressures , according to Information
Theory , is to transmit information at a constant rate ( Genzel and Charniak , 2002 ) , making linguistic choices that reduce fluctuations in the density of the information transmitted .
Evidence for the principle of uniform information density ( UID ; Jaeger and Levy , 2007 ; Jaeger , 2010 ) has been found at many levels of language production : speakers tend to reduce the duration of more predictable sounds
Turk , 2004 , 2006 ; Bell et al. , 2003 ; Demberg et al. , 2012 ) ; they tend to drop sentential material within more predictable scenarios ( Jaeger and Levy , 2007 ; Jaeger , 2010 ; Frank and Jaeger , 2008 ) ; in spoken dialogue they are more likely to overlap at turn transitions when information density is low ( Dethlefs et al. , 2016 ) ; and the rate at which they transmit information in texts is uniform Charniak , 2002 , 2003 ; Qian and Jaeger , 2011 ) .
Empirically , it is as yet unclear whether information density remains uniform throughout conversations ( Vega and Ward , 2009 ; Doyle and Frank , 2015 a , b ; Xu and Reitter , 2018 ) .
That information density is not always uniform in dialogue may be due to the complex structure of conversational context ( Clark and Brennan , 1991 ) , which not only includes previous utterances and world knowledge , but can also comprise preceding interactions between the interlocutors , their perceptual input , and their goals .
This paper tests the UID principle on the previously unexplored setting of task - oriented dialogue , with its well - defined structural units and more constrained context than in open domain dialogues .
To estimate information density , we use a pre-trained Transformer - based language model , which provides more robust measurements than the n-gram models used in prior work .
We study whether , and within which structural units the UID principle holds , finding new evidence in support of it in certain structural units of both written cooperative reference games and spoken map navigation dialogues .

Our study highlights the importance of identifying relevant con-textual structures , showing that topically and referentially related contextual units correspond to more uniform information transmission profiles .
Measuring Information Content
To investigate whether information density is uniform throughout a discourse , each lexical choice can be modelled as a random variable Y i and its information density estimated as the Shannon information content H( Y i ) .
For the UID principle to hold , the amount of information transmitted with every new word H( Y i ) must remain constant .
We can rewrite H( Y i ) as H( X i | L i , C i ) , where C i is the entire relevant context and L i is the local context , both influencing lexical choice X i .
Typically , H( X i | C i , L i ) is not estimated directly .
The term is further decomposed into H( X i | L i ) , the information content of X i given the local context , and I ( X i ; C i | L i ) , the locally conditioned mutual information between X i and the entire relevant context : H( X i | C i , L i ) ?
H( X i | L i ) ? I ( X i ; C i | L i ) [ 1 ]
As the relevant context is built up , I ( X i ; C i | L i ) is assumed to increase : next word prediction becomes easier when more contextual cues are available ( Genzel and Charniak , 2002 ) .
So for the UID principle to hold - i.e. , for H( X i | C i , L i ) to remain constant in Eq. 1 - the locally conditioned information content H( X i | L i ) must increase , too , as relevant context accumulates .
The local context of a word choice is typically taken to be the utterance or sentence , and these are also considered as the units of information transmission Charniak , 2002 , 2003 ; Doyle and Frank , 2015 a , b ; Qian and Jaeger , 2011 ; Xu and Reitter , 2018 ) .
The information content of an utterance is computed by averaging over the negative logarithms of all locally contextualised word probabilities : H( X|L ) = ?
1 |X | x i ?X log 2 P ( x i |x 1 , ... , x i?1 ) [ 2 ]
To remove the confounding effect of utterance length on information content ( Keller , 2004 ) , we use Xu and Reitter 's ( 2018 ) normalised metric of utterance information content : H ( X ) = H ( X ) | L ( n ) | S?L( n ) H ( S ) [ 3 ] where L(n ) is the set of all utterances of length n and X ? L ( n ) ; for simplicity , we leave out the conditioning variable .
Data and Hypotheses
The UID principle is assumed to hold within a structural unit that determines the type and size of the overall relevant context C i as used in Eq. 1 . Charniak ( 2002 , 2003 ) show that , in texts , part of the relevant context is lexical ( writers tend to reuse words that have already appeared in the discourse ) and topically determined , as given by the paragraph structure of texts .
In dialogue , defining a topically relevant contextual unit is not straightforward .
Xu and Reitter ( 2018 ) use a topic segmentation algorithm to identify relevant units in unconstrained dialogues and show that information density is influenced by topic shift .
Here we exploit the inherent ( task - related ) structure of taskoriented dialogues to test the UID principle within contextual units of different type and size .
We analyse two corpora of task-oriented English dialogues : MapTask ( MT , Anderson et al. , 1991 ) 2 and Photo-Book ( PB , Haber et al. , 2019 ) 3 . Dialogue excerpts from both corpora can be found in Appendix A. MT contains 128 transcribed spoken dialogues consisting of an instruction giver directing an instruction follower to navigate to a point on a map .
The participants cannot see the other 's map and their respective maps may contain slightly different landmarks .
We consider two types of contextual unit : a ) the overall dialogue : a series of landmarks are described in succession to help the instruction follower draw a path towards a goal location ; b) a dialogue transaction : a dialogue excerpt related to reaching a certain landmark , manually annotated as part of the corpus .
For both types of contextual unit , we also construct versions where we use the MT dialogue act annotation to filter out turns exclusively consisting of backchannels and other grounding acts ( ' okay ' , ' mmhmm ' ) common in spoken language .
4
This results in contextual units that focus on information - transmission dialogue acts and are more referentially coherent .
PB contains 2,500 dialogues where two participants without specified roles communicate via written chat .
Each dialogue consists of 5 rounds : in each round , each participant sees a set of photographs which partially overlap with the set of images seen by their dialogue partner .
The goal is to find out which images they have in common .
The images available to each participant change in each round , but a subset reappears , thus triggering subsequent references to previously described photographs .
This task design allows us to investigate the following types of contextual unit : a ) the overall dialogue : throughout a game , all the photographs are about a certain domain ( e.g. , food or dogs ) ; b) a dialogue round : different images are described in succession as participants try to figure out which ones they share in a given round ; c ) an image reference chain : the ( non- adjacent ) utterances that refer to a certain image across rounds ( we use the automatic annotation of referring utterance chains by Takmaz et al. , 2020 ) .
We hypothesise that , in MT , the UID principle will be more visible at the transaction level , where the context is more topically coherent , than at the dialogue level , where a dozen different landmarks are brought up in succession - in particular when only information - transmission dialogue acts are taken into account .
In PB , we expect the strongest effect to be present at the level of reference chains .
Chains are determined both topically , by the target image , and lexically , by the conceptual pacts established in previous mentions of a target ( Brennan and Clark , 1996 ) .
In rounds and dialogues , where several different images are described , topic and lexical choices are constrained by the image domain but the vocabulary used in previous turns is more varied .
We thus expect the effect to be less pronounced at these two levels .
Modelling
To estimate the information content of an utterance we compute the log probabilities in Eq. 2 using GPT - 2 ( Radford et al. , 2019 ) , a pre-trained Transformer language model , which allows us to obtain more accurate probability estimates than n-gram models .
We rely on HuggingFace 's implementation of GPT - 2 with default tokenizers and default parameters ( Wolf et al. , 2020 ) .
As GPT - 2 was pretrained mainly on written text , it is less tuned to the idiosyncrasies of dialogue data .
We therefore finetune it separately on a 70 % split of each target corpus .
5
As shown in Table 1 , finetuning yields a substantial reduction in the model 's perplexity .
More information on model parameters and the finetuning procedure can be found in Appendix B .
We use the finetuned language models to estimate the information content ( Eq. 3 ) of the 30 % held - out portion of each corpus , and count turn positions ( i.e. , the positions of utterances within a dialogue - or a smaller structural unit ) from the beginning of the relevant structural unit .
6 Following Xu and Reitter ( 2018 ) , to test whether utterance information remains uniform we fit a linear mixedeffect model using the logarithm of information content as response variable and the logarithm of turn position as predictor .
We include a random slope for the turn position and a random intercept term grouped by distinct dialogues , which allows us to model variation among individual speakers as a function of their addressee .
We adopt Genzel and Charniak 's assumption that the mutual information I ( X i ; C i |L i ) between an utterance and its context increases with turn position ( Genzel and Charniak , 2002 , see Section 2 ) ; so for H( S i | C i , L i ) to remain stable , utterance information content H( S i | L i ) , too , must increase .
Consequently , we consider the UID principle to hold when turn position has a significant positive effect on information content .
Validation
To validate our estimates of utterance information content , we replicate Genzel and Charniak 's ( 2002 ; ) and Keller 's ( 2004 ) study on the Wall Street Journal articles of the Penn Treebank ( Mitchell et al. , 1999 ) 7 using GPT - 2 finetuned on this corpus ( see Table 1 ) .
In the original studies , the authors measure the correlation between the position of sentences within newspaper articles - as well as within paragraphs - and the sentence information content , as measured using n-gram language models .
As mentioned above , these studies assume that I ( X i ; C i |L i ) increases as discourse context is built up , and test whether the locally conditioned information content H( X i | L i ) , too , increases throughout articles and paragraphs .
In our validation study , we take both entire articles and paragraphs as structural units and count sentence positions from the beginning of the relevant unit .
Our linear mixed - effect models show a significant positive effect of sentence position on information content both within articles ( ? = 1.65e?2 , p < 0.001 ) and within paragraphs ( ? = 1.53e?2 , p < 0.01 ) .
To reproduce the original experimental setting , we further train an n-gram language model with interpolated Kneser - Ney smoothing using Keller 's ( 2004 ) data split and select the configuration with the lowest perplexity on the test set , a 3 - gram model with a discount value of 0.8 .
In line with previous work , we find a positive Kendall 's rank - correlation 8 between sentence position and information , as measured with the n-gram model as well as with the Transformers .
The original results are therefore replicated .

Results
We test whether the UID principle holds in MT and PB using the procedure presented in Section 4 .
The full results of our statistical analysis can be found in Appendix E ( Tables 6 and 7 ) .
Recall that for the principle to hold , the locally conditioned information content H( X i | L i ) must increase with the position of X i in the relevant context unit C i .
The local context L i is defined as a dialogue turn .
MapTask
When we take entire MT dialogues as the contextual unit , we do not find a positive effect of turn position on information content , regardless of whether we focus in information - transmission dialogue acts 8 Our data consist of multiple measurements for each sentence position ( one for each document ) , thus causing a large number of ties ( i.e. , multiple entries with the same sentence position but different entropy estimates ) .
We choose Kendall 's test for all our experiments because it deals with ties better than other correlation tests such as Spearman 's or Pearson's .
9 A detailed description of the experimental setup and the full results can be found in Appendix D. ( see Figure 1a for the results with all dialogue acts ) .
In contrast , the types of dialogue act considered affect our results on transactions .
We fail to find an effect in transactions with backchannels but the linear mixed - effect models show a positive effect of turn position within transactions without backchannels ( ? = 2.38e?2 , p < 0.001 ) .
We attribute these findings to the nature of the task .
Over the course of a dialogue , speakers traverse a map naming different landscape features and therefore are unable to establish more than a minimal level of linguistic routine at the dialogue level .
Transactions , on the other hand , correspond to more referentially constrained subtasks ; this becomes more evident when information - transmission dialogue acts are isolated from transmission - coordination acts .
Analysing the instruction giver and follower informationtransmission turns independently reveals that there is no significant effect for instruction followers ; the overall positive effect is driven by the instruction givers ( ? = 3.46e?2 , p < 0.001 ; see Figure 1 b ) .
This reflects the asymmetric nature of information transmission in MT dialogues .
PhotoBook
The effect of position on information content is positive within the PB dialogues ( ? = 3.13e?2 , p < 0.001 ) ;
Figure 1 c shows a consistently increasing sawtooth pattern for information content , providing evidence that participants optimise their information - transmission strategy throughout PB games .
Information content slightly decreases within game rounds ( ? = ?0.74e?2 , p < 0.005 ) , yet this effect is mainly due to the higher estimates obtained for the first turns of these contextual units ( see Figure 3e in Appendix E ) , often used by participants to coordinate on how to start the new round .
Because multiple images are discussed in a round , this contextual unit seems not to capture the relevant context of individual dialogue turns nor be large enough to display the participants ' overall information transmission strategy that we observe at the dialogue level .
Finally , as hypothesised , the effect of position on information content is positive at the reference chain level ( ? = 1.27e ?2 , p < 0.001 ) .
As participants re-refer to an image over the game , they increase the density of their messages ( as shown in Figure 1d ) and also decrease message length ( Kendall 's correlation between position in chain and length is ? = ?0.268 , p < 0.001 ) .
Thus , as reference chains unfold , the reduction process observed by Takmaz et al . ( 2020 ) is complemented by information compression .
The relatively low magnitude of the fixed effect as well as that of the correlation between utterance length and chain position , however , suggest that the process we see at play is not only one of compression and reduction .
Figure 1d indeed shows that the fourth position in a chain often comes with a decrease in information content , perhaps indicating that once a conceptual pact has been established between interlocutors , referential expressions can be significantly simplified without losing referential power - as in the following reference chain ( information content estimates in parenthesis ) : 1 . ' Man eating slice of pizza ' ( 0.69 ) 2 . ' last one for me is guy with pizza ' ( 0.78 ) 3 . ' pizza eater ' ( 0.91 ) 4 . ' pizza ' ( 0.67 )
Conclusion
We investigated to what extent the principle of uniform information density holds in two corpora of English task - oriented dialogues .
We have related the properties of task - determined contextual units to patterns of information transmission and have hypothesised that the UID principle holds to a stronger degree in more topically coherent and reference -specific contextual units .
Our hypotheses are confirmed in PhotoBook , where we find evidence that dialogue participants use rational strategies of information transmission over an entire dialogue .
We do not observe uniformity of information in the MapTask dialogues and transactions as a whole , similarly to other negative results in interactive settings ( e.g. , Vega and Ward , 2009 ; Doyle and Frank , 2015 b ) .
Yet the effect is present within MapTask transactions when we restrict our analysis to information - transmission dialogue acts : these make for a more topically and referentially coherent contextual unit .
Indeed , the organisation of context can be complex in dialogues .
We have shown that theoretically motivated contextual units such as reference chains in PhotoBook and information - transmission acts in MapTask transactions are good candidates to characterise the relevant context over which participants deploy strategies of information compression .
We are aware that the assumptions used to test the UID principle , which we have adopted from Genzel and Charniak 's seminal work ( 2002 ) - i.e. , that context informativeness increases as strongly as sentence entropy as discourse is built up - can be controversial .
Nevertheless , in this paper we have followed this line of reasoning , used in previous work ( Genzel and Charniak , 2003 ; Vega and Ward , 2009 ; Qian and Jaeger , 2011 ; Doyle and Frank , 2015 b ; Xu and Reitter , 2018 ) , and applied it to novel data and contextual units .
In Giulianelli and Fern?ndez ( 2021 ) , we go one step further and empirically test these assumptions for the first time , using direct estimates of the contextualised entropy H( S i | C i , L i ) of an utterance and thus of the informativity of its linguistic context I ( S i ; C i , L i ) .
The study presented in this paper provides new empirical evidence on language production in dialogue which we believe can directly inform the development of natural language generation models .
Our findings suggest that models that take relevant contextual units into account ( Takmaz et al. , 2020 ; Hawkins et al. , 2020 ) are better suited for reproducing human patterns of information transmission , and confirm that the use of training objectives that enforce a uniform organisation of information density ( Meister et al. , 2020 ; Wei et al. , 2021 ) is a promising avenue for training language models .
