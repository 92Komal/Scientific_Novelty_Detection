SimCLS : A Simple Framework for Contrastive Learning of Abstractive Summarization
abstract
In this paper , we present a conceptually simple while empirically powerful framework for abstractive summarization , SIMCLS , which can bridge the gap between the learning objective and evaluation metrics resulting from the currently dominated sequence - to-sequence learning framework by formulating text generation as a reference - free evaluation problem ( i.e. , quality estimation ) assisted by contrastive learning .
Experimental results show that , with minor modification over existing topscoring systems , SimCLS can improve the performance of existing top-performing models by a large margin .
Particularly , 2.51 absolute improvement against BART ( Lewis et al. , 2020 ) and 2 .50 over PEGASUS ( Zhang et al. , 2020a ) w.r.t ROUGE - 1 on the CNN / DailyMail dataset , driving the state - of - the - art performance to a new level .
We have open-sourced our codes and results : https://github.

Results of our proposed models have been deployed into EX - PLAINABOARD ( Liu et al. , 2021a ) platform , which allows researchers to understand our systems in a more fine - grained way .
Introduction Sequence-to-sequence ( Seq2Seq ) neural models ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ) have been widely used for language generation tasks , such as abstractive summarization ( Nallapati et al. , 2016 ) and neural machine translation .
While abstractive models ( Lewis et al. , 2020 ; Zhang et al. , 2020a ) have shown promising potentials in the summarization task , they share the widely acknowledged challenges of Seq2Seq model training .
Specifically , Seq2Seq models are usually trained under the framework of Maximum Likelihood Estimation ( MLE ) and in practice they are commonly trained with the teacher - forcing ( Williams and Zipser , 1989 ) algorithm .
This introduces a gap between the objective function and the evaluation metrics , as the objective function is based on local , token - level predictions while the evaluation metrics ( e.g. ROUGE ( Lin , 2004 ) ) would compare the holistic similarity between the gold references and system outputs .
Furthermore , during the test stage the model needs to generate outputs autoregressivelly , which means the errors made in the previous steps will accumulate .
This gap between the training and test has been referred to as the exposure bias in the previous work ( Bengio et al. , 2015 ; Ranzato et al. , 2016 ) .
A main line of approaches ( Paulus et al. , 2018 ; Li et al. , 2019 ) proposes to use the paradigm of Reinforcement Learning ( RL ) to mitigate the aforementioned gaps .
While RL training makes it possible to train the model with rewards based on global predictions and closely related to the evaluation metrics , it introduces the common challenges of deep RL .
Specifically , RL - based training suffers from the noise gradient estimation ( Greensmith et al. , 2004 ) problem , which often makes the training un-stable and sensitive to hyper-parameters .
Minimum risk training , as an alternative , has also been used in the language generation tasks ( Shen et al. , 2016 ; Wieting et al. , 2019 ) .
However , the accuracy of the estimated loss is restricted by the number of sampled outputs .
Other methods ( Wiseman and Rush , 2016 ; Edunov et al. , 2018 ) aim to extend the framework of MLE to incorporate sentence - level scores into the objective functions .
While these methods can mitigate the limitations of MLE training , the relation between the evaluation metrics and the objective functions used in their methods can be indirect and implicit .
Among this background , in this work we generalize the paradigm of contrastive learning ( Chopra et al. , 2005 ) to introduce an approach for abstractive summarization which achieves the goal of directly optimizing the model with the corresponding evaluation metrics , thereby mitigating the gaps between training and test stages in MLE training .
While some related work ( Lee et al. , 2021 ; Pan et al. , 2021 ) Stage II : Reference-free Evaluation
The highlevel idea is that a better candidate summary S i should obtain a higher quality score w.r.t the source document D .
We approach the above idea by contrastive learning and define an evaluation function h( ? ) that aims to assign different scores r 1 , ? ? ? , r n to the generated candidates solely based on the similarity between the source document and the candidate S i , i.e. , r i = h( S i , D ) .
The final output summary S is the candidate with the highest score : S = argmax S i h( S i , D ) .
( 1 ) Here , we instantiate h( ? ) as a large pre-trained selfattention model , RoBERTa .
It is used to encode S i and D separately , and the cosine similarity between the encoding of the first tokens is used as the similarity score r i .
Contrastive Training Instead of explicitly constructing a positive or negative example as most existing work with contrastive learning have adopted , here the " contrastiveness " is reflect in the diverse qualities of naturally generated summaries evaluated by a parameterized model h( ? ) .
Specifically , we introduce a ranking loss to h ( ? ) : L = i max ( 0 , h( D , Si ) ? h( D , ? ) ) + i j>i max ( 0 , h( D , Sj ) ? h( D , Si ) + ?ij ) , ( 2 ) where S1 , ? ? ? ,
Sn is descendingly sorted by M ( Si , ? ) .
Here , ? ij = ( j ?i ) * ? is the corresponding margin that we defined following Zhong et al . ( 2020 ) , and ? is a hyper-parameter .
1 M can be any automated evaluation metrics or human judgments and here we use ROUGE ( Lin , 2004 ) .
3 Experiments
Evaluation Metrics
We use ROUGE -1/2/L ( R-1/2/L ) as the main evaluation metrics for our experiments .
We also evaluate our model on the recently developed semantic similarity metrics , namely , BERTScore ( Zhang et al. , 2020 b ) and MoverScore ( Zhao et al. , 2019 ) .
Base Systems
As the generation model and the evaluation model in our two -stage framework are trained separately , we use pre-trained state - of - the - art abstractive summarization systems as our generation model .
Specifically , we use BART ( Lewis et al. , 2020 ) and Pegasus ( Zhang et al. , 2020a ) as they are popular and have been comprehensively evaluated .
Training Details
For baseline systems , we use the checkpoints provided by the
Results on CNNDM dataset
The results on CNNDM dataset are shown in Tab .
1 . We use the pretrained BART 5 as the base generation model ( Origin ) .
We use BART , Pegasus , GSum ( Dou et al. , 2021 ) and ProphetNet ( Qi et al. , 2020 ) for comparison .
Notably , the Max oracle which always selects the best candidate has much better performance than the original outputs , suggesting that using a diverse sampling strategy can further exploit the potential power of the pretrained abstractive system .
Apart from ROUGE , we also present the evaluation results on semantic similarity metrics .
Our method is able to outperform the baseline model on all metrics , demonstrating its improvement is beyond exploiting the potential artifacts of ROUGE .
While the scale of improvement is harder to interpret with these metrics , we note that the improvement is able to pass the significance test .

With the constraints of computation power , we try to use as many candidates as possible for the evaluation model training .
However , we also notice that our method is robust to the specific number of candidates , as during test we found that our model is still able to outperform the baseline model with fewer candidates , which is illustrated in Fig. 2 .
Fine-grained Analysis
To demonstrate that our method is able to make meaningful improvement w.r.t the summary quality , here we compare our method with the baseline model at different semantic levels on CNNDM .
Entity - level Inspired by the work of Gekhman et al . ( 2020 ) and Jain et al . ( 2020 ) , we compare the model performance w.r.t the salient entities , which are entities in source documents that appear in the reference summaries .
Specifically , ( 1 ) we extract the entities from the source documents , 6 ( 2 ) select the salient entities based on the entities in reference summaries , ( 3 ) compare the salient entities with entities in candidate summaries .
Results in Tab .
3 demonstrate that our method can better capture the important semantic information of the source documents .
Sentence-level Sentence Alignments
Here we investigate if our method makes sentence - level differences compared to the baseline model .
Specifically , ( 1 ) we match each sentence in the summaries to a sentence in the source documents based on their similarity ( indicated by ROUGE scores ) , 7 ( 2 ) compute the sentence - level similarity between the reference and system- generated summaries based on the overlaps of their matched sentences in the source documents .
The results in Tab .
3 demonstrate that the generated summaries of our method is more similar to the reference summaries at the sentence level .
Positional Bias In Tab. 2 , we present a case study of the sentence alignment .
We use the same matching approach to map the summary sentences to the sentences in source articles .
In this example , the output of our method focuses on the same sentences as the reference summary does , while the baseline summary focuses on some different sentences .
Interestingly , the reference summary focuses on the very last sentence in the article , and our method can follow this pattern .
Upon examining this pattern , we notice a positional bias of abstractive models when handling long source articles ( more than 1069 30 sentences ) .
Fig. 3 shows that the baseline summaries are more likely to focus on the head sentences compared to the references , which may result from the autoregressive generation process of the Seq2Seq models .
Our method is able to mitigate this bias , as the candidate sampling process ( diverse beam search ) generates candidates different from the original outputs , and our evaluation model can assess the holistic quality of the candidates .
Results on XSum dataset
To evaluate our method 's performance beyond CNNDM dataset , we also test our method on XSum dataset , and the results are shown in Tab .
4 . Here , we use Pegasus 8 as the base system since it achieves better performance than BART on XSum .
We follow the same sampling strategy to generate the training data .
However , as this strategy generally results in lower ROUGE - 2 score on XSum dataset , we use a different strategy to generate the validation and test data ( 4 candidates generated by 4 diverse groups ) .
Our method is still able to outperform the baseline , but with a smaller margin compared to CNNDM .
Summaries in XSum are shorter ( one-sentence ) and more abstractive , which restricts the semantic diversity of candidates and makes it harder to make meaningful improvement .
Conclusion
In this work , we present a contrastive summarization framework that aims to optimize the quality of generated summaries at summary - level , which mitigates the discrepancy between the training and test Figure 1 : 1 Figure 1 : SimCLS framework for two -stage abstractive summarization , where Doc , S , Ref represent the document , generated summary and reference respectively .
At the first stage , a Seq2Seq generator ( BART ) is used to generate candidate summaries .
At the second stage , a scoring model ( RoBERTa ) is used to predict the performance of the candidate summaries based on the source document .
The scoring model is trained with contrastive learning , where the training examples are provided by the Seq2Seq model .
