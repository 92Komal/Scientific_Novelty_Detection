UIR - PKU : Twitter - OpinMiner System for Sentiment Analysis in Twitter at SemEval 2015
abstract
Microblogs are considered as We-Media information with many real-time opinions .
This paper presents a Twitter - OpinMiner system for Twitter sentiment analysis evaluation at SemEval 2015 .
Our approach stems from two different angles : topic detection for discovering the sentiment distribution on different topics and sentiment analysis based on a variety of features .
Moreover , we also implemented intra-sentence discourse relations for polarity identification .
We divided the discourse relations into 4 predefined categories , including continuation , contrast , condition , and cause .
These relations could facilitate us to eliminate polarity ambiguities in compound sentences where both positive and negative sentiments are appearing .
Based on the SemEval 2014 and SemEval 2015
Twitter sentiment analysis task datasets , the experimental results show that the performance of Twitter - OpinMiner could effectively recognize opinionated messages and identify the polarities .
Introduction
This year comes the third edition of SemEval Twitter sentiment analysis task consisting of new genres , including topic-based polarity classification , trends detection towards a topic , and the sentimental strength of association of terms ( Nakov et al. , 2013 ) .

We only participated in the subtask of message sentiment analysis and built up a system , named Twitter - OpinMiner for the task .
Twitter - OpinMiner stems from two different angles : LDAbased topic detection for discovering the opinionated features of trending tweets ' topics and sentiment analysis based on a variety of features .
? Topic detection Recent studies show that people often search Twitter to find temporally relevant information ( Teevan et al. , 2011 ) , such as emergent events , trending topics .
In fact , similar opinions were likely to express on the same topic / event in Twitter .
For example , there are 20 tweets expressing similar opinions on " Blood moon " in SemEval 2015 dataset .
Therefore , it can facilitate us to discover the sentiment distribution on different topics .
? Sentiment analysis
Unlike traditional news content , tweets are specialists in short texts with long compound sentences , and a number of irregular expressions , including emoticon , hashtag , and special punctuations .
In order to better support tweets analysis , we extract features from following aspects : textual content , irregular expression , discourse relations , and word embedding .
Then we introduce above features into a SVM classifier for sentiment analysis .
This paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 describes the framework of our system .
Section 3 introduces the details of our feature extraction .
We present the evaluation results in Section 4 .
Finally , Section 5 concludes the paper .
System Overview
Architecture
The architecture of Twitter - OpinMiner is described in Figure 1 . Twitter - OpinMiner system is comprised of three modules : ( 1 ) Pre-processing module : reads all data of training data and test data .
It performs , POS tagging , named entity recognition , and semantic role labeling .
( 2 ) Feature extraction module : extracts the features including formal text features , tweet -specific features , discourse features , sentiment distribution among topics , and word embedding .
( 3 ) Sentiment analysis module : creates a SVM classifier that incorporates the above features classify the polarity of each tweet .
Finally , Twitter - OpinMiner outputs the polarity of each tweet .
Development Data and Lexicon
The data are necessary in our system .
We fully utilize the training tweets provided by SemEval 2013 .
The dataset consists of 9,912 annotated tweets .
Besides , for sentiment analysis , we also utilize several sentiment lexicons , including Liu 's sentiment lexicon ( Liu , 2012 ) , MPQA subjectivity lexicon ( Wilson et al. , 2005 ) , and the sentiment lexicon generated from tweets ( Mohammad et al. , 2013 ) .

Feature Extraction
The objective of this task is to determine whether a given message is positive , negative , or neutral .
We train sentiment classifiers with LibLinear ( Fan et al. , 2008 ) on the training set and dev set , and tune parameter ?c , ?wi of SVM on the test set of SemEval 2013 .
SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm , the effectiveness of which has been proved in sentiment analysis on formal texts in related work ( Pang and Lee , 2002 ; Liu , 2012 ) .
Since the performance of SVM classifier will be greatly influenced by the features selection , we explore a variety of features in the evaluation .
Features of topical sentiment distribution
The advancement of Twitter is fast response to the real world , so people often search Twitter to find temporally relevant information , such as emergent events , trending topics .
In fact , tweets are likely to converge on some opinions for a specific topic , which will lead to different sentiment distributions among topics .
In our system , we adopt LDA - based approach for representing the typical sentiment distribution features .
We use the Mallet toolkit , set the topic number as 50 , and map each tweet into 50 dimensions to extract those features .
Features of formal text Although the task is to analyze sentiment in Twitter , much research proved the effectiveness of the classic features of formal texts on tweets .
The features we adopted in this task are partly the same with ( Zhou et al. , 2010 )
Results
These features are also integrated into our SVM classifier for training and treated as the baseline in our experiment .
Twitter specific feature Unlike formal texts , tweet has its own characteristics , including irregular expressions , emoticon , hashtag , ill format , and special punctuations .
In our system , we combine the features proposed by Mohammad et al . ( 2013 ) with some new features as Twitter -specific features for supplementary to the forma text .
?
Hashtags : the number of hashtags in one tweet ; ?
Ill format : the presence of ill format with some characters replacing by * , for example , f** k ; ?
Punctuation : the number of contiguous sequences of exclamation marks , question marks , and both exclamation and question marks ; whether the last token contains an exclamation or question mark ; ?
Emoticons : the presence of positive and negative emoticons at any position in the tweet ; whether the last token is an emoticon ; ? OOV : the ratio of words out of vocabulary ; ?
Elongated words : the presence of sentiment words with one character repeated more than two times , for example , ' cooool ' ; ? URL : whether the tweet contains a URL .
? Reply or Retweet :
Is the current tweet a reply / retweet tweet
Word embedding
We also utilize word embedding technique for feature extraction .
We adopt sentiment -specific word embedding method ( Tang et al. , 2014 ) that could encode sentiment information in the continuous representation of words .
In our approach , each term is extended into a 150 dimensional vector .
Discourse specific feature Since tweets are usually expressed informally , there are many compound sentences in a tweet , which always contain positive sentiment and negative sentiment with ambiguity .
For example ,
It may not be the biggest squad in the last 10yrs , but Ancelotti is working for quality over quantity .
Everyone ...

In this case , there are two segments in the tweet that holds a Contrast discourse relation , and the polarity is determined by " but " segment .
In our system , we also take into consideration of intrasentence discourse relation features for processing compound sentences .
Mann and Thompson ( 1988 ) defined a complete discourse scheme Rhetorical Structure Theory ( RST ) .
Since not all of the discourse relations in RST would help eliminate polarity ambiguities , the discourse relations were implemented in our system was on a subset ( Zhou et al. , 2011 ) .
In our system , we use cue-phrase based method for discourse relation identification .
We maintain a cue phrase lexicon and the examples of the cue phrases were shown in Table 2 .
Experiment
We trained a SVM classifier on 9,912 annotated tweets ( 8,258 in the training set and 1,654 in the development set ) .
We used the same evaluation metrics with SemEval 2013 , including the macroaveraged F-score of the positive and negative classes .
The experimental results obtained by our system on the training set ( ten - fold cross validation ) , development set , and test sets on Twitter 2013 were shown in Table 3 where the baseline was achieved by using the formal text features as well as twitterspecific features .
Since the effectiveness of these two types of features were analyzed in ( Mohammad et al. , 2013 ) , we mainly evaluated the effectiveness of other features .
Table 3 showed that the most effective feature on Twitter 2013 dataset turned out to be the word embedding features : they provided gains of about 7 % .
For LDA , we set the numbers of topic from 10 to 100 , and found it could achieve best performance when equaling 50 .
We then constructed the sentiment distribution among 50 topics for the further evaluation .
Besides , we also investigated the effectiveness of discourse features on compound sentences , and the statistics were shown in Table 6 .
By adopting discourse features , around 59 % sentences with discourse relations were identified .
Among these four types of relations , better performance were achieved on cause and condition relations .
Especially for the sentences with condition relation , they were all classified correctly .
It is because that more cue-phrase of cause and condition relations were used to explicitly denote the discourse relations in tweets , but more likely use context to imply contrast and continuation relations .
Table 4 and Table 5 showed the evaluation results in SemEval 2015 Task 10 .
Compared with the best run in Table 5 , our system achieved comparable results on Twitter sentiment analysis and better performance on the evaluation of sarcasm .
In fact , many sarcasm are likely expressed in ironic , hence most feature types are ineffective for this case .
In our system , we also used the features of topical sentiment distribution , which assumed the polarity of sarcasm tweet the same with non-sarcasm tweets .
Conclusion
We describe our Twitter - OpinMiner systems for participating in SemEval 2015 sentiment analysis in Twitter .
Our approach stems the features from two different aspects : topical sentiment distribution and a variety of short text based features .
In our paper , we also implemented intra-sentence discourse relations for polarity identification in compound sentences where both positive and negative sentiments are appearing .
In this way , the polarity ambiguities will be eliminated .
Based on SemEval 2015 and SemEval 2014 datasets for Twitter sentiment analysis task , we examined the performance of Twitter - OpinMiner , which could achieved comparable results on recognizing opinionated messages and identifying the polarities .
