Multilingual Connotation Frames : A Case Study on Social Media for Targeted Sentiment Analysis and Forecast
abstract
People around the globe respond to major real world events through social media .
To study targeted public sentiments across many languages and geographic locations , we introduce multilingual connotation frames : an extension from English connotation frames of Rashkin et al . ( 2016 ) with 10 additional European languages , focusing on the implied sentiments among event participants engaged in a frame .
As a case study , we present large scale analysis on targeted public sentiments toward salient events and entities using 1.2 million multilingual connotation frames extracted from Twitter .
Introduction People around the globe use social media to express their reflections and opinions on major real world events ( Atefeh and Khreich , 2015 ; Radinsky and Horvitz , 2013 ) .
In order to facilitate multilingual public sentiment tracking on social media , we introduce multilingual connotation frames , 1 a multilingual extension from English connotation frames of Rashkin et al . ( 2016 ) with 10 additional European languages , including low-resource languages such as Polish , Finnish , and Russian .
Definition 1.1 . Connotation Frames :
A framework for encoding predicate -specific connotative relationships implied by a predicate towards its arguments .
Figure 1 shows a selected subset of the connotation frames that is relevant in our study .
See Rashkin et al. ( 2016 ) for the full description of the connotation frames .

There are two important benefits to develop multilingual connotation frames .
First , they serve as a unique lexical resource to enable targeted sentiment analysis , which rarely exists for most languages .
Definition 1.2 . Targeted Sentiment :
A sentiment label indicating how a source entity feels about a target entity .
In the example shown in Figure 1 , " teenager survived Boston Marathon bombing " , the connotation frame allows us to correctly interpret ( implied ) targeted sentiments including : 1 . sentiment ( teenager ? bombing ) = - 2. sentiment ( writer ? bombing ) = - 3 . sentiment ( writer ? teenager ) = +
Second , they allow us to study a broad spectrum of sentiments including nuanced ones ; in the ex- amples discussed above , connotation frames allow us to infer ( 1 ) the likely sentiment among the event participants ( e.g. , a surviving teenager is likely to be negative toward the Boston bombing ) , and ( 2 ) the likely sentiment of the author towards events and entities ( e.g. , the writer is likely to be sympathetic toward the teenager while negative toward the incident ) , even though none of these sentiment implications are overtly expressed .
To validate the empirical utility of the new multilingual connotation lexicon , we present a successful case study of large scale connotation analysis ( Section 4.1 ) and forecast ( Section 4.2 ) based on connotation frames extracted from 1.2 million tweets in 10 different European languages spanning over a 15 day period .
Multilingual Twitter Dataset
We obtained multilingual geo-located tweets spanning Mar 15 - Mar 29 , 2016 .
This 15 day duration covers Brussels attacks on Mar 22 as well as one whole week before and after , allowing us to study the public sentiment dynamics in response to a major terrorist event .
We focus on tweets that are likely to be about " news - worthy " topics by selecting tweets that came from trusted sources such as twitter - verified accounts or known news accounts , or contained hashtags # breaking or # news .
2 We used SyntaxNet dependency parser ( Andor et al. , 2016 ) and trained additional Syn-taxNet models for 10 non-English languages using Universal Dependencies annotations .

We extracted 1.2 million agent-verb-theme tuples as listed in Table 1 . 3 Methods
Multilingual Connotation Frames
We perform context- based projection of English connotation frames to 10 additional European languages using large parallel corpora .
Since connotation of a word arises from the context in which the word is used , we want to ensure the translated connotation frames are used in similar contexts .
We use existing parallel corpora with automatic word-alignment : the Opus Corpus ( Tiedemann , 2012 ) using Multi- UN parallel data ( Eisele and Chen , 2010 ) for Russian and EuroParl parallel data ( Koehn , 2005 ) for all other languages .
More concretely , for each non-English verb , v ( e.g. , assassiner in French ) , we compute the probability of it being translated to English verb v by counting the alignments .
We then define the connotation frame of v , F ( v ) , by transferring the connotation frame of the English verb v * , F ( v * ) , that has the highest translation probability : v * = argmax v p( v|v ) F ( v ) = F ( v * )
For example , the connotation frame for assassiner is propagated from murder , the English word that it is aligned with the most .
Extracting Targeted Sentiments
Using the connotation frame lexicon , we compute the distribution of targeted sentiments towards most-frequently - mentioned named entities .
We also compute sentiments expressed by each country by aggregating all sentiments of the writers located in that country ( e.g. , the distribution of positive , neutral , and negative perspectives expressed towards Obama in British tweets ) .
The aggregated polarities can be represented as a 3 dimensional probability vector , = [ p + p = p ? ] , as will be used in the sentiment forecast task below .
For other analysis , we summarize this polarity distribution as a scalar score by taking the expected value of the polarity : E [ p ] = p + ? p ? .
Forecasting Sentiment Dynamics
We also study forecasting sentiment dynamics : predicting the sentiment distribution of the next day given the sentiment trend of previous days .
For this task , we track the distribution of directional sentiments from each country towards the hundred most-frequently - mentioned named entities .
At test-time , each model is given directional sentiment distributions for the previous 4 days as input and predicts tomorrow 's distribution ( e.g. , forecasting 1 day ahead ) .
We also train models for predicting the distribution half a week later ( forecasting 4 days ahead ) .
We performed an additional experiment for English ( EN J ) where the perspectives of all countries are aggregated together in order to predict the global perspective .
For all experiments , we use 10 - fold cross-validation and measure the symmetric Kullback - Leibler ( KL ) divergence between the true distribution and the predicted one .
We experiment with Long Short-term Memory models ( LSTMs ) ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) to integrate the dynamic contextual information from the past , as depicted in 2 .
Hidden dimension is 16 , and we use ADAM optimization with KL divergence as the objective .
For implementation , we use Keras 4 on top of Theano .
5 Baselines
We use two baselines .
The first is MEAN , the average distribution seen in the training data .
The second are SVMs with linear kernels , which worked well in predicting influenza activity in a similar set- up ( Santillana et al. , 2015 ) .
For the baselines , we encode the distributions from the 4 previous days as a flattened 12 - dim .
vector , and each portion of the distribution is predicted separately .
Results
Connotation Analysis
For the most frequently mentioned named entities , we compute heatmaps of the expected perspective being expressed towards that entity .
In Figure 3A , we use the English tweets from European countries to plot the change in connotative polarity towards these entities over the course of the 15 day period .
Generally , the changes in polarity from day - to - day seem to be gradual and frequently are similar to the day before .
There are a couple of exceptions e.g. , the polarity towards Brussels changes abruptly on March 22 ( the day of the Brussels attacks ) , reflecting the change in tone of all tweets related to Brussels at that time .
Overall , there are mostly positive polarities expressed .
This may reflect people 's tendency to avoid phrasing stories too harshly , choosing to be more euphemistic even when they discuss bad news .
In Figure 3B , we aggregated the polarities of these tweets by country of origin .
While most of the polarities are positive -strongly positive , the tweets about Brussels and Belgium are more neutral or even slightly negative .
Lastly , in Figure 3C , we used all of the tweets from European countries to aggregate expected polarities in 11 different languages .
Non-English languages show a much higher tendency towards positive scores , particularly the languages with less tweets ( Polish , Finnish , Swedish ) .
As a more detailed analysis , Figure 4 shows a heatmap of how the connotation expressed towards Obama shifts over time across different languages .
Obama was not discussed much in Finnish or Swedish , whereas he was discussed everyday in English , Spanish , and Russian .
In the middle of the two week period , the perspective towards Obama drops slightly , most notably in Spanish , which overlaps with his controversial trip to Cuba ( March 20 - 22 ) .
Sentiment Dynamics In Table 2 , we summarize the results of our experiments for predicting targetted sentiment dynamics .
For each language , we report the average Kullback - Leibler divergence for the baselines and the LSTM model ( higher scores are worse ) .
We show prediction results in two settings : predicting the distribution one day ahead vs. four days ahead .
The LSTM outperforms the baselines in most languages with a few exceptions , such as Portuguese .
All models perform worse at forecasting 4 days into the future than one day ahead , demonstrating how much connotation can vary over time as news events change , even in a small time period .
On average , the LSTM achieves KL - divergence of 1.7 when predicting one day ahead and 3.26 when predicting 4 days ahead , lower than any of the baselines .
Error Analysis
For error analysis , we removed entities from Figure 3 from the training data and used them as a small test set for an LSTM trained on the remaining data in English with aggregation over all countries .
In Figure 5 , we have plotted the predicted marginal probabilities of four entities with the positive portion of the distribution ( blue line ) on the top half of the y-axis and the negative portion ( red line ) flipped onto the negative half of the axis .
The LSTM follows the general shape of the true curves , but frequently misses sudden spikes ( e.g. , the spike in negative polarity towards Russia on March 27th ) .
In Table 3 , we also report the KL divergences on predictions towards these entities .
The model tends to perform less well at predicting sentiment towards entities where there were sudden spikes in sentiment based on news stories .
Related Work
There have been substantial studies for sentiment analysis on twitter ( Agarwal et al. , 2011 ; Kouloumpis et al. , 2011 ; Pak and Paroubek , 2010 ; Table 3 : Error analysis on held - out entities .
Liu and Zhang , 2012 ) , as well as targetted sentiment ( Deng and Wiebe , 2015 ) , implicit sentiment ( Deng and Wiebe , 2014 ; Feng et al. , 2013 ; Greene and Resnik , 2009 ) and specific aspects of subjective language ( Mohammad and Turney , 2010 ; Choi and Wiebe , 2014 ) in other domains .
Previous investigations include using targetted sentiment to predict international relations ( Chambers et al. , 2015 ) , analyzing stylistic elements to predict tweet popularity ( Tan et al. , 2014 ) , and exploring the re-phrasing of social media posts referencing specific news articles ( Tan et al. , 2016 ) .
Compared to most prior studies that focused on overt sentiment in English-only tweets , our work aims to study targeted implied sentiments across temporal , spatial , and linguistic borders .
Some work ( Tsytsarau et al. , 2014 ; O'Connor et al. , 2010 ; De et al. , 2016 ) has analyzed the transition of overt sentiment over a period of time and related the shifts in sentiment to news events .
A body of work has also used predictive signals in Twitter to track and sense upcoming unrest and protests in specific countries ( Ramakrishnan et al. , 2014 ; Goode et al. , 2015 ) , and the future progression of flu activity based on multiple text sources ( Santillana et al. , 2015 ) .
In contrast , we focus on predicting the sentiment dynamics in social media based on previous trends .
Conclusions
When reporting news , people write with their own implicit and explicit biases and judgments .
An author 's choice of language reveals connotations towards entities , which can be captured within the connotation frames that we have extended to 10 European languages .
This work is one of the first to present a large scale analysis of multilingual connotation dynamics , and helps explore multiple perspectives on diverse issues across languages , time and countries - a critical piece in understanding journalistic portrayal and biases .

We experimented with other automatic ways of finding news sources by identifying popular hashtags , but this method did not translate well to other languages .
