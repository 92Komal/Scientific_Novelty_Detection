IIT -TUDA at SemEval - 2016 Task 5 : Beyond Sentiment Lexicon : Combining Domain Dependency and Distributional Semantics Features for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
abstract
This paper reports the IIT-TUDA participation in the SemEval 2016 shared Task 5 of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) for subtask 1 .
We describe our system incorporating domain dependency graph features , distributional thesaurus and unsupervised lexical induction using an unlabeled external corpus for aspect based sentiment analysis .
Overall , we submitted 29 runs , covering 7 languages and 4 different domains .
Our system is placed first in sentiment polarity classification for the English laptop domain , Spanish and Turkish restaurant reviews , and opinion target expression for Dutch and French in restaurant domain , and scores in medium ranks for aspect category identification and opinion target extraction .
Introduction
The advent of web technologies has made an unprecedented opportunity for online users to share and explain their views and opinions .
The corelation between the views expressed by the users and the market strategies by the organizations strikes the importance of analyzing such reviews .
But , valuable as they are , user- generated review texts are unstructured and very noisy .
Major research studies adopted Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) and text mining techniques to better understand and process various types of information in user-generated reviews .
Such efforts have come to be known as opinion mining , sentiment analysis or review mining ( Pang and Lee , 2008 ) .
Aspect level analysis performs a finer-grained sentiment analysis by addressing three subproblems : extracting aspects from the review text , identifying the entity that is referred to by the aspect , and finally classifying the opinion polarity towards the aspect ( Liu , 2012 ) .
For example , a review of the " entity " laptop is likely to discuss distinct " aspects " like size , processing unit , and memory , and a single product can trigger a positive " opinion " about one feature , and a negative " opinion " about another .
In an attempt to support the efforts on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) , the SemEval 2016 shared Task 5 ABSA ( Pontiki et al. , 2016 ) offers the opportunity to experiment and evaluate on benchmark datasets ( reviews ) across various domains and languages through three subtasks .
Subtask 1 covers the three sub-problems mentioned above , namely : aspect category identification ( Slot 1 ) , opinion target expression ( OTE ) ( Slot 2 ) and sentiment polarity classification ( Slot 3 ) .
We participated in Slot 1 and Slot 3 for English , Spanish , Dutch , French , Turkish , Russian and Arabic language for all available domains except telecoms .
We also conducted experiments for Slot 2 Method for Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
In this section , we describe our data preprocessing and feature extraction .
We also introduce an unsupervised approach for expanding the coverage of existing lexical resources based on the notion of distributional thesaurus .
We use Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) ( Cortes and Vapnik , 1995 ) as the baseline classifier for aspect category detection and sentiment polarity classification , and Conditional Random Fields ( CRF ) ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ) for opinion target expression identification .
Preprocessing
We tokenize the data using Stanford tokenizer , normalize all digits to ' num ' and remove stop words for tf-idf computation .
ternal reviews dataset to compute tf-idf .
We use movies reviews 3 for Spanish ; and books , music and DVD reviews 4 for French .
The resulting graphs were filtered and only ' amod ' ( adjective modifying a noun ) and ' nsubj ' ( nominal subjects of predicates ) relations were selected .
For each extracted aspect from the opinion - aspect pairs , we determine the existence or absence of this aspect using a binary feature .
? Distributional Thesaurus : A Distributional Thesaurus ( DT ) is an automatically computed lexical resource that ranks words according to the semantic similarity .
We employ an open source implementation of DT computation as described in ( Biemann and Riedl , 2013 ) .
For every top five significant words based on tfidf score in each aspect category ( for example : ' overpriced ' , '$ ' , ' pricey ' , ' cheap ' , ' expensive ' are the most significant terms in ' food# price ' category ) , we find ten most similar words according to DT .
The presence or absence of these words in the review is used as a feature for aspect category identification .
Examples from the distributional thesaurus are presented in Table 1 . ? Tf - Idf Score : Each aspect category has some discriminative aspect terms .
We extract a maximum of top five distinguishing words in each category based on tf-idf score .
Presence or absence of each token in the review denotes the feature .
?
Bag of Words :
This feature denotes the number of occurrences of each word in the review .
Features for Opinion Target Expression ?
Word and Local Context :
We use the current token , its lowercase form and the context tokens in a window of [ - 5.. 5 ] as features .
? Part-of-Speech ( PoS ) Information :
We use PoS information of the current , preceding two and following two tokens as the features .
?
Head Word and its PoS : We use the head word of the noun phrase and PoS information of the head word .
? Prefix and Suffix : We use prefix and suffix of length up to four characters .
? Frequent Aspect Term :
We build a list of frequently occurring OTEs from the training set .
An OTE is considered to be frequent if it appears at least four times in the training corpus .
We define a binary feature for the presence or absence of extracted OTEs .
? Dependency Relations :
In English language , features are defined in line with ( Toh and Wang , 2014 ) .
For other languages , feature is defined by considering whether the current token is present in dependency relations ' nsubj ' , ' dep ' , ' amod ' , ' nmod ' and ' dobj ' or not .
?
Character N-grams :
We use all substrings up to length 5 of the current token as features .
?
Orthographic feature :
This feature checks whether the current token starts with the capitalized letter or not .
?
DT features :
We use the top 5 DT expansions of current token as the features .
? Expansion Score : OTEs have opinion around them .
Opinions are regularly lexicalized with words found in sentiment lexicons .
We calculate sentiment score based on SentiWordNet 5 ( Esuli and Sebastiani , 2006 ) in English language .
For Non-English language , we use our induced lexicons .
We calculate sentiment score by considering the window size of 10 ( preceding 5 and following 5 tokens of the target one ) .
We additionally extract the following features only for English language .
?
Chunk information :
To identify the boundaries of multi-word OTEs , we use chunk information of the current token as the features .
?
Lemma : Lemmatization trims the inflectional forms and derivationally related forms of a token to a common base form .
?
WordNet :
We use top 4 noun synsets of current token from WordNet as the features .
?
Named entity information :
We extract named entity information of the current token with Stanford CoreNLP tool , and use the NERsequence labels in BIO - scheme as features .
Features for Sentiment Polarity Classification ? Lexical Acquisition :
We use lexical expansion for inducing sentiment words based on distributional hypothesis .
We observe that for rare words , unseen instances and limited coverage of available lexicons , the distributional expansion can provide a useful backoff technique , also cf .
( Govind et al. , 2014 ) .
For all languages , we construct a polarity lexicon using an external corpus and seed sentiment lexicon .
For seed lexicons , we use English ( Salameh et al. , 2015 ) and Arabic ( Salameh et al. , 2015 ) versions of Bing Liu 's lexicon ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) for English and Arabic respectively , VU sentiment lexicon 6 for French , Dutch and Spanish , a lexicon by ( Panchenko , 2014 ) for Russian , and Senti-TurkNet ( Dehkharghani et al. , 2015 ) of more than 50 in the background corpus ( English 8 , French 9 , Spanish 10 , Dutch 11 , Russian 12 , Arabic 13 ) .
Finally , we compute the normalized positive , negative and neutral score for each word similar to ( Kumar et al. , 2015 ) , and inspired by ( Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown , 1997 ) .
The core assumption is that words tend to be semantically more similar to words of same sentiment .
Hence , words appearing more in the expansions of positive ( negative / neutral ) words get assigned a higher positive ( negative / neutral ) sentiment score , Here , in difference to ( Kumar et al. , 2015 ) , we compute normalized positive , negative and neutral scores rather than assigning one of the polarity class to the words .
It should be noted that the volume of induced lexicon depends on two factors : ( i ) number of words in the seed lexicon that have expansions and ( ii ) pruning threshold for obtaining the induced lexicon .
The unavailability of expansions for all words in the seed lexicon and higher threshold on conditions for accepting candidate terms reduces the volume of induced lexicon .
Expansion statistics for the induced lexicons are provided in Table 2 .
We compute the sum of positive , negative and 8 https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ web-Amazon.html 9 http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it/doku.php?

de neutral scores of tokens using induced lexicon for that language as features .
In addition , scores as given in the seed lexicon are also used as features .
For English , we also computed these features from different lexicons : AFINN ( Nielsen , 2011 ) , NRC Hashtag , Sentiment 140 ( Zhu et al. , 2014 ) , NRC Emotion ( Mohammad and Turney , 2013 ) and Bing Liu ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) . ?
Word N-gram :
All unigrams and bigrams tokens are extracted from the training set are used as a binary feature , where 1 and 0 indicates the presence and absence of n-grams in the review .
? Entity -Attribute Pair :
We use E#A pair as a binary feature for sentiment classification .
Datasets , Experimental Results and Discussions
For feature selection and hyperparameter tuning , we perform five - fold cross-validation on the training set .
For Slot 1 and Slot 3 , we use supervised classification using Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) 14 . Based on cross-validation results , we set the probability threshold of 0.185 , 0.13 and 0.145 for restaurants , laptops and phones , respectively , for predicting aspect categories in the review .
All E#A pairs having predicted probability greater than the threshold are enlisted as aspect categories .
For Slot 2 , we use CRFSuite 15 with default parameters .

Teams were allowed to submit their systems in two modes : constrained and unconstrained modes .
In constrained mode , the participants are allowed to use only the resources and dataset provided by the organizers whereas in unconstrained submission , participants can use any external resource .
For Slot 2 and Slot 3 , we only sent unconstrained submission , while for Slot 1 we sent constrained as well as unconstrained submissions except for Russian restaurants .
Our system achieves the best results in sentiment polarity classification for reviews about English laptops , Spanish restaurants and Turkish restaurants .
We score second for English restaurants .
We also produce the maximum F1 - score value for opinion target expression for French and Dutch restaurants .
Our evaluation results across all domains and lan-guages are given in Table 3 .
The results show that our system performs comparably well for sentiment polarity classification and opinion target expression .
A feature ablation experiment given in Table 4 shows the effectiveness of induced lexicon for Slot 3 task .
We get a significant improvement on adding information from the induced lexicons in each language .
This holds especially for languages other than English , where existing sentiment lexicons are less comprehensive .
We also note that entity - attribute pairs also help in resolving conflicting sentiments ( for example : cheap food ( positive ) to cheap service ( negative ) ) .
We score in medium ranks for Slot 1 task .
Distributional thesaurus based expansion for discriminative terms and aspects obtained through domain dependency graph results in marginal increments .
This could be attributed to conflict in very fine grained aspect categories ( for example : Restaurant # Prices , Food # Prices , Drink # Prices )
After the evaluation period , we revised our feature representation to ensure that it matches the correct input format for CRF .
We also added two new features including unsupervised PoS tags ( Biemann , 2009 ) as the feature for all the languages and Sen-tiWordNet score for English language .
For the current token , we use PoS tag , distributional thesaurus , lexical expansion score , unsupervised PoS tag , Sen-tiWordNet score of context tokens [ - 2 , - 1 , 0 , 1 , 2 ] , prefix ( upto 3 - character ) , suffix ( upto 3 - character ) and chunk information of context tokens [ - 1 , 0 , 1 ] .
The updated results of after modification are shown in Table 5 .
If we had incorporated these changes earlier , we would have scored third for English and first for the other three languages .
Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper , we report our work on the task of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis , which covers three slots : aspect identification , opinion target extraction and sentiment polarity classification .
By leveraging a distributional thesaurus , we expand the existing domain specific aspect list and sentiment lexicons for different languages to reach a higher coverage on sentiment words .
Our system was ranked first in five out of 29 submitted runs .
While performance is satisfactory for Slot 3 and Slot 2 ( after correction ) , our setup compares infavorably to others for Slot 1 .
We will continually improve our system in future work .

it is For opinion target expression , we run Stanford CoreNLP 1 suite in order to extract information such as lemma , Part- of - Speech ( PoS ) and named entity ( NE ) in English language .
For languages other than English , we use the universal parser 2 for tokenization and parsing .
Since we deal with the OTE as a sequence labelling problem ,
