Summarizing Opinions : Aspect Extraction Meets Sentiment Prediction and They Are Both Weakly Supervised
abstract
We present a neural framework for opinion summarization from online product reviews which is knowledge - lean and only requires light supervision ( e.g. , in the form of product domain labels and user-provided ratings ) .
Our method combines two weakly supervised components to identify salient opinions and form extractive summaries from multiple reviews : an aspect extractor trained under a multi-task objective , and a sentiment predictor based on multiple instance learning .
We introduce an opinion summarization dataset that includes a training set of product reviews from six diverse domains and human-annotated development and test sets with gold standard aspect annotations , salience labels , and opinion summaries .
Automatic evaluation shows significant improvements over baselines , and a largescale study indicates that our opinion summaries are preferred by human judges according to multiple criteria .

Introduction Opinion summarization , i.e. , the aggregation of user opinions as expressed in online reviews , blogs , internet forums , or social media , has drawn much attention in recent years due to its potential for various information access applications .
For example , consumers have to wade through many product reviews in order to make an informed decision .
The ability to summarize these reviews succinctly would allow customers to efficiently absorb large amounts of opinionated text and manufacturers to keep track of what customers think about their products ( Liu , 2012 ) .
The majority of work on opinion summarization is entity -centric , aiming to create summaries from text collections that are relevant to a particular entity of interest , e.g. , product , person , company , and so on .
A popular decomposition of the problem involves three subtasks ( Hu and Liu , 2004 , 1 Our code and dataset are publicly available at https : //github.com/stangelid/oposum .
2006 ) : ( 1 ) aspect extraction which aims to find specific features pertaining to the entity of interest ( e.g. , battery life , sound quality , ease of use ) and identify expressions that discuss them ; ( 2 ) sentiment prediction which determines the sentiment orientation ( positive or negative ) on the aspects found in the first step , and ( 3 ) summary generation which presents the identified opinions to the user ( see Figure 1 for an illustration of the task ) .
A number of techniques have been proposed for aspect discovery using part of speech tagging ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) , syntactic parsing ( Lu et al. , 2009 ) , clustering ( Mei et al. , 2007 ; Titov and McDonald , 2008 b ) , data mining ( Ku et al. , 2006 ) , and information extraction ( Popescu and Etzioni , 2005 ) .
Various lexicon and rule-based methods ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ; Ku et al. , 2006 ; Blair-Goldensohn et al. , 2008 ) have been adopted for sentiment prediction together with a few learning approaches ( Lu et al. , 2009 ; Pappas and Popescu-Belis , 2017 ; Angelidis and Lapata , 2018 ) .
As for the summaries , a common format involves a list of aspects and the number of positive and negative opinions for each ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) .
While this format gives an overall idea of people 's opinion , reading the actual text might be necessary to gain a better understanding of specific details .
Textual summaries are created following mostly extractive methods ( but see Ganesan et al.
2010 for an abstractive approach ) , and various formats ranging from lists of words ( Popescu and Etzioni , 2005 ) , to phrases ( Lu et al. , 2009 ) , and sentences ( Mei et al. , 2007 ; Blair-Goldensohn et al. , 2008 ; Lerman et al. , 2009 ; Wang and Ling , 2016 ) .
In this paper , we present a neural framework for opinion extraction from product reviews .
We follow the standard architecture for aspect-based summarization , while taking advantage of the success of neural network models in learning continuous features without recourse to preprocessing tools or linguistic annotations .
Central to our system is the ability to accurately identify aspect- Figure 1 : Aspect- based opinion summarization .
Opinions on image quality , sound quality , connectivity , and price of an LCD television are extracted from a set of reviews .
Their polarities are then used to sort them into positive and negative , while neutral or redundant comments are discarded .
specific opinions by using different sources of information freely available with product reviews ( product domain labels , user ratings ) and minimal domain knowledge ( essentially a few aspectdenoting keywords ) .
We incorporate these ideas into a recently proposed aspect discovery model ( He et al. , 2017 ) which we combine with a weakly supervised sentiment predictor ( Angelidis and Lapata , 2018 ) to identify highly salient opinions .
Our system outputs extractive summaries using a greedy algorithm to minimize redundancy .
Our approach takes advantage of weak supervision signals only , requires minimal human intervention and no gold -standard salience labels or summaries for training .
Our contributions in this work are three - fold : a novel neural framework for the identification and extraction of salient customer opinions that combines aspect and sentiment information and does not require unrealistic amounts of supervision ; the introduction of an opinion summarization dataset which consists of Amazon reviews from six product domains , and includes development and test sets with gold standard aspect annotations , salience labels , and multi-document extractive summaries ; a large-scale user study on the quality of the final summaries paired with automatic evaluations for each stage in the summarization pipeline ( aspects , extraction accuracy , final summaries ) .
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines in terms of opinion extraction accuracy and similarity to gold standard summaries .
Human evaluation further shows that our summaries are preferred over comparison systems across multiple criteria .
Related Work
It is outside the scope of this paper to provide a detailed treatment of the vast literature on opinion summarization and related tasks .
For a compre-hensive overview of non-neural methods we refer the interested reader to Kim et al . ( 2011 ) and Liu and Zhang ( 2012 ) .
We are not aware of previous studies which propose a neural - based system for end-to - end opinion summarization without direct supervision , although as we discuss below , recent efforts tackle various subtasks independently .
Aspect Extraction Several neural network models have been developed for the identification of aspects ( e.g. , words or phrases ) expressed in opinions .
This is commonly viewed as a supervised sequence labeling task ; Liu et al . ( 2015 ) employ recurrent neural networks , whereas Yin et al . ( 2016 ) use dependency - based embeddings as features in a Conditional Random Field ( CRF ) .
combine a recursive neural network with CRFs to jointly model aspect and sentiment terms .
He et al. ( 2017 ) propose an aspect-based autoencoder to discover fine- grained aspects without supervision , in a process similar to topic modeling .
Their model outperforms LDA - style approaches and forms the basis of our aspect extractor .
Sentiment Prediction Fully - supervised approaches based on neural networks have achieved impressive results on fine- grained sentiment classification ( Kim , 2014 ; Socher et al. , 2013 ) .
More recently , Multiple Instance Learning ( MIL ) models have been proposed that use freely available review ratings to train segment - level predictors .
Kotzias et al. ( 2015 ) and Pappas and Popescu-Belis ( 2017 ) train sentence - level predictors under a MIL objective , while our previous work ( Angelidis and Lapata , 2018 ) introduced MILNET , a hierarchical model that is trained end-to -end on document labels and produces polarity - based opinion summaries of single reviews .
Here , we use MILNET to predict the sentiment polarity of individual opinions .
Multi-document Summarization
A few extractive neural models have been recently applied to generic multi-document summarization .
Cao et al. ( 2015 ) train a recursive neural network using a ranking objective to identify salient sentences , while follow - up work ( Cao et al. , 2017 ) employs a multi-task objective to improve sentence extraction , an idea we adapted to our task .
Yasunaga et al. ( 2017 ) propose a graph convolution network to represent sentence relations and estimate sentence salience .
Our summarization method is tailored to the opinion extraction task , it identifies aspect-specific and salient units , while minimizing the redundancy of the final summary with a greedy selection algorithm ( Cao et al. , 2015 ; Yasunaga et al. , 2017 ) .
Redundancy is also addressed in Ganesan et al . ( 2010 ) who propose a graph - based framework for abstractive summarization .
Wang and Ling ( 2016 ) introduce an encoder-decoder neural method for extractive opinion summarization .
Their approach requires direct supervision via gold -standard extractive summaries for training , in contrast to our weakly supervised formulation .
Problem Formulation
Let C denote a corpus of reviews on a set of products E C = {e i } |E C | i=1 from a domain d C , e.g. , televisions or keyboards .
For every product e , the corpus contains a set of reviews R e = {r i } | Re | i=1 expressing customers ' opinions .
Each review r i is accompanied by the author 's overall rating y i and is split into segments ( s 1 , . . . , s m ) , where each segment s j is in turn viewed as a sequence of words ( w j1 , . . . , w jn ) .
A segment can be a sentence , a phrase , or in our case an Elementary Discourse Unit ( EDU ; Mann and Thompson 1988 ) obtained from a Rhetorical Structure Theory ( RST ) parser ( Feng and Hirst , 2012 ) .
EDUs roughly correspond to clauses and have been shown to facilitate performance in summarization , document - level sentiment analysis ( Bhatia et al. , 2015 ) , and single-document opinion extraction ( Angelidis and Lapata , 2018 ) .
A segment may discuss zero or more aspects , i.e. , different product attributes .
We use A C = { a i } K i=1 to refer to the aspects pertaining to domain d C .
For example , picture quality , sound quality , and connectivity are all aspects of televisions .
By convention , a general aspect is assigned to segments that do not discuss any specific aspects .
Let A s ?
A C denote the set of aspects mentioned in segment s ; pol s ? [ ? 1 , + 1 ] marks the polarity a segment conveys , where ?1 indicates maximally negative and + 1 maximally positive sentiment .
An opinion is represented by tuple o s = ( s , A s , pol s ) , and O e = {o s } s?Re represents the set of all opinions expressed in R e .
For each product e , our goal is to produce a summary of the most salient opinions expressed in reviews R e , by selecting a small subset S e ? O e .
We expect segments that discuss specific product aspects to be better candidates for useful summaries .
We hypothesize that general comments mostly describe customers ' overall experience , which can also be inferred by their rating , whereas aspect-related comments provide specific reasons for their overall opinion .
We also assume that segments conveying highly positive or negative sentiment are more likely to present informative opinions compared to neutral ones , a claim supported by previous work ( Angelidis and Lapata , 2018 ) .
We describe our novel approach to aspect extraction in Section 4 and detail how we combine aspect , sentiment , and redundancy information to produce opinion summaries in Section 5 .
Aspect Extraction
Our work builds on the aspect discovery model developed by He et al . ( 2017 ) , which we extend to facilitate the accurate extraction of aspect-specific review segments in a more realistic setting .
In this section , we first describe their approach , point out its shortcomings , and then present the extensions and modifications introduced in our Multi- Seed Aspect Extractor ( MATE ) model .
Aspect - Based Autoencoder
The Aspect- Based Autoencoder ( ABAE ; He et al. 2017 ) is an adaptation of the Relationship Modeling Network ( Iyyer et al. , 2016 ) , originally designed to identify attributes of fictional book characters and their relationships .
The model learns a segment- level aspect predictor without supervision by attempting to reconstruct the input segment 's encoding as a linear combination of aspect embeddings .
ABAE starts by pairing each word w with a pre-trained word embedding v w ?
R d , thus constructing a word embedding dictionary L ? R V ?d , where V is the size of the vocabulary .
The model also keeps an aspect embedding dictionary A ? R K?d , where K is the number of aspects to be identified and i-th row a i ?
R d is a point in the word embedding space .
Matrix
A is initialized using the centroids from a k-means clustering on the vocabulary 's word embeddings .
The autoencoder , first produces a vector v s for review segment s = ( w 1 , . . . , w n ) using an attention encoder that learns to attend on aspect words .
A segment encoding is computed as the weighted average of word vectors : v s = n i=1 c i v w i ( 1 ) c i = exp( u i ) n j=1 exp ( u j ) ( 2 ) u i = v T w i ?
M ? v s , ( 3 ) where c i is the i-th word 's attention weight , v s is a simple average of the segment 's word embeddings and attention matrix M ? R d?d is learned during training .
Vector v s is fed into a softmax classifier to predict a probability distribution over K aspects : p asp s = softmax ( Wv s + b ) , ( 4 ) where W ? R K?d and b ?
R K are the classifier 's weight and bias parameters .
The segment 's vector is then reconstructed as the weighted sum of aspect embeddings : r s = A T p asp s . ( 5 ) The model is trained by minimizing a reconstruction loss J r ( ? ) that uses randomly sampled segments n 1 , n 2 , . . . , n kn as negative examples : 2 J r ( ? ) = s?C kn i=1 max ( 0 , 1 ? r s v s + r s v n i ) ( 6 ) ABAE is essentially a neural topic model ; it discovers topics which will hopefully map to aspects , without any preconceptions about the aspects themselves , a feature shared with most previous LDA - style aspect extraction approaches ( Titov and McDonald , 2008a ;
He et al. , 2017 ; Mukherjee and Liu , 2012 ) .
These models will set the number of topics to be discovered to a much larger number ( ? 15 ) than the actual aspects found in the data ( ? 5 ) .
This requires a many - to- one mapping between discovered topics and genuine aspects which is performed manually .
Multi-Seed Aspect Extractor Dynamic aspect extraction is advantageous since it assumes nothing more than a set of relevant reviews for a product and may discover unusual and interesting aspects ( e.g. , whether a plasma television has protective packaging ) .
However , it suffers from the fact that the identified aspects are finegrained , they have to be interpreted post-hoc , and manually mapped to coarse-grained ones .
We propose a new weakly - supervised set - up for aspect extraction which requires little human involvement .
For every aspect a i ?
A C , we assume there exists a small set of seed words { sw j } l j=1 which are good descriptors of a i .
We can think of these seeds as query terms that someone would use to search for segments discussing a i .
They can be set manually by a domain expert or selected using a small number of aspect-annotated reviews .
Figure 2 ( top ) depicts four television aspects ( image , sound , connectivity and price ) and three of their seeds in word embedding space .
MATE replaces ABAE 's aspect dictionary with multiple seed matrices { A 1 , A 2 , . . . , A K }. Every matrix A i ?
R l?d , contains one row per seed word and holds the seeds ' word embeddings , as illustrated by the set of [ 3 ? 2 ] matrices in Figure 2 . MATE still needs to produce an aspect matrix A ? R K?d , in order to reconstruct the input segment 's embedding .
We accomplish this by reducing each seed matrix to a single aspect embedding with the help of seed weight vectors z i ?
R l ( j z ij = 1 ) , and concatenating the results , illus-trated by the [ 4 ? 2 ] aspect matrix in Figure 2 : a i = A T i z i ( 7 ) A = [ a T 1 ; . . . ; a T K ] . ( 8 ) The segment is reconstructed as in Equation ( 5 ) .
Weight vectors z i can be uniform ( for manually selected seeds ) , fixed , learned during training , or set dynamically for each input segment , based on the cosine distance of its encoding to each seed embedding .
Our experiments showed that fixed weights , selected through a technique described below , result in most stable performance across domains .
We only focus on this variant due to space restrictions ( but provide more details in the supplementary material ) .
When a small number of aspect-annotated reviews are available , seeds and their fixed seed weights can be selected automatically .
To obtain a ranked list of terms that are most characteristic for each aspect , we use a variant of the clarity scoring function which was first introduced in information retrieval ( Cronen- Townsend et al. , 2002 ) .
Clarity measures how much more likely it is to observe word w in the subset of segments that discuss aspect a , compared to the corpus as a whole : score a ( w ) = t a ( w ) log 2 t a ( w ) t ( w ) , ( 9 ) where t a ( w ) and t ( w ) are the l 1 - normalized tf - idf scores of w in the segments annotated with aspect a and in all annotated segments , respectively .
Higher scores indicate higher term importance and truncating the ranked list of terms gives a fixed set of seed words , as well as their seed weights by normalizing the scores to add up to one .
Table 1 shows the highest ranked terms obtained for every aspect in the televisions domain of our corpus ( see Section 6 for a detailed description of our data ) .
Multi-Task Objective MATE ( and ABAE ) relies on the attention encoder to identify and attend to each segment 's aspectsignalling words .
The reconstruction objective only provides a weak training signal , so we devise a multi-task extension to enhance the encoder 's effectiveness without additional annotations .
We assume that aspect-relevant words not only provide a better basis for the model 's aspect- based reconstruction , but are also good indicators of the product 's domain .
For example , the words colors and crisp , in the segment " The colors are perfectly crisp " should be sufficient to infer that the seg - p dom s = softmax ( W C v s + b C ) , ( 10 ) where p dom s = p ( d C 1 ) , p ( d C 2 ) , . . . is a probability distribution over product domains for segment s and W C and b C are the classifier 's weight and bias parameters .
We use the negative log likelihood of the domain prediction as the objective function , combined with the reconstruction loss of Equation ( 5 ) to obtain a multi-task objective : J MT ( ? ) = J r ( ? ) ? ? s?C all log p ( ds ) , ( 11 ) where ? controls the influence of the classification loss .
Note that the negative log-likelihood is summed over all segments in C all , whereas J r ( ? ) is only summed over the in-domain segments s ? C 1 .
It is important not to use the out-of- domain segments for segment reconstruction , as they will confuse the aspect extractor due to the aspect mismatch between different domains .
Opinion Summarization
We now move on to describe our opinion summarization framework which is based on the aspect extraction component discussed so far , a polarity prediction model , and a segment selection policy which identifies and discards redundant opinions .

Given review r consisting of segments ( s 1 , . . . , s m ) , MILNET uses a CNN segment encoder to obtain segment vectors ( u 1 , . . . , u m ) , each used as input to a segment - level sentiment classifier .
For every vector u i , the classifier produces a sentiment prediction p stm i = p ( 1 ) i , . . . , p ( M ) i , where p ( 1 ) i and p ( M ) i are probabilities assigned to the most negative and most positive sentiment class respectively .
Resulting segment predictions ( p stm 1 , . . . , p stm m ) are combined via a GRU - based attention mechanism to produce a document- level prediction p stm r and the model is trained end-to- end on the reviews ' user ratings using negative log-likelihood .
The essential by -product of MILNET are segment - level sentiment predictions p stm i , which are transformed into polarities pol s i , by projecting them onto the [ ? 1 , + 1 ] range using a uniformly spaced sentiment class weight vector .
Opinion Ranking Aspect predictions p asp s = p ( a 1 ) s , . . . , p ( a K ) s and polarities pol s , form the opinion set O e = {( s , A s , pol s ) }
s?Re for every product e ? E C .
For simplicity , we set the predicted aspect-set A s to only include the aspect with the highest probability , although it is straightforward to allow for multiple aspects .
We rank every opinion o s ?
O e according to its salience : sal ( o s ) = | pol s | ? ( max i p ( a i ) s ? p ( GEN ) s ) , ( 12 ) where the quantity in parentheses is the probability difference between the most probable aspect and the general aspect .
The salience score will be high for opinions that are very positive or very negative and are also likely to discuss a non-general aspect .
Opinion Selection
The final step towards producing summaries is to discard potentially redundant opinions , something that is not taken into account by our salience scoring method .
Table 2 shows a partial ranking of the most salient opinions found in the reviews for an LCD television .
All segments provide useful information , but it is evident that segments 1 and 6 as well as 4 and 5 are paraphrases of the same opinions .
We follow previous work on multi-document summarization ( Cao et al. , 2015 ; Yasunaga et al. , 2017 ) and use a greedy algorithm to eliminate redundancy .
We start with the highest ranked opinion , and keep adding opinions to the final summary one by one , unless the cosine similarity between the candidate segment and any segment already included in the summary is lower than 0.5 .
The OPOSUM Dataset
We created OPOSUM , a new dataset for the training and evaluation of Opinion Summarization models which contains Amazon reviews from six product domains : Laptop Bags , Bluetooth Headsets , Boots , Keyboards , Televisions , and Vacuums .
The six training collections were created by downsampling from the Amazon Product Dataset 3 introduced in McAuley et al . ( 2015 ) and contain reviews and their respective ratings .
The reviews were segmented into EDUs using a publicly available RST parser ( Feng and Hirst , 2012 ) .
To evaluate our methods and facilitate research , we produced a human-annotated subset of the dataset .
For each domain , we uniformly sampled ( across ratings ) 10 different products with 10 reviews each , amounting to a total of 600 reviews , to be used only for development ( 300 ) and testing ( 300 ) .
We obtained EDU - level aspect annotations , salience labels and gold standard opinion summaries , as described below .
Statistics are provided in Table 3 and in supplementary material .
Aspects
For every domain , we pre-selected nine representative aspects , including the general aspect .
We presented the EDU - segmented reviews to three annotators and asked them to select the aspects discussed in each segment ( multiple aspects were allowed ) .
Final labels were obtained using a majority vote among annotators .
Interannotator agreement across domains and annotated segments using Cohen 's Kappa coefficient was K = 0.61 ( N = 8,175 , k = 3 ) .
Opinion Summaries
We produced opinion summaries for the 60 products in our benchmark using a two -stage procedure .
First , all reviews for a product were shown to three annotators .
Each annotator read the reviews one- by-one and selected the subset of segments they thought best captured the most important and useful comments , without taking redundancy into account .
This phase produced binary salience labels against which we can judge the ability of a system to identify important opinions .
Again , using the Kappa coefficient , agreement among annotators was K = 0.51 ( N = 8,175 , k = 3 ) .
4
In the second stage , annotators were shown the salient segments they identified ( for every product ) and asked to create a final extractive summary by choosing opinions based on their popularity , fluency and clarity , while avoiding redundancy and staying under a budget of 100 words .
We used ROUGE ( Lin and Hovy , 2003 ) as a proxy to inter-annotator agreement .
For every product , we treated one ref-erence summary as system output and computed how it agrees with the rest .
ROUGE scores are reported in Table 5 ( last row ) .
Experiments
In this section , we discuss implementation details and present our experimental setup and results .
We evaluate model performance on three subtasks : aspect identification , salient opinion extraction , and summary generation .
Implementation Details Reviews were lemmatized and stop words were removed .
We initialized MATE using 200 - dimensional word embeddings trained on each product domain using skipgram ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 ) with default parameters .
We used 30 seed words per aspect , obtained via Equation ( 9 ) .
Word embeddings L , seed matrices { A i } K i=1 and seed weight vectors { z i } K i=1 were fixed throughout training .
We used the Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) with learning rate 10 ?4 and mini-batch size 50 , and trained for 10 epochs .
We used 20 negative examples per input for the reconstruction loss and , when used , the multi-tasking coefficient ? was set to 10 .
Seed words and hyperparameters were selected on the development set and we report results on the test set , averaged over 5 runs .
Aspect Extraction
We trained aspect models on the collections of Table 3 and evaluated their predictions against the human-annotated portion of each corpus .
Our MATE model and its multitask counterpart ( MATE + MT ) were compared against a majority baseline and two ABAE variants : vanilla ABAE , where aspect matrix
A is initialized using k-means centroids and fine-tuned during training ; and ABAE init , where rows of A are fixed to the centroids of respective seed embeddings .
This allows us to examine the benefits of our multi-seed aspect representation .
Opinion Salience
We are also interested in our system 's ability to identify salient opinions in reviews .
The first phase of our opinion extraction annotation provides us with binary salience labels , which we use as gold standard to evaluate system opinion rankings .
For every product e , we score each segment s ?
R e using Equation ( 12 ) and evaluate the obtained rankings via Mean Average Precision ( MAP ) and Precision at the 5th retrieved segment ( P@5 ) .
5 Polarity scores were produced via MILNET ; we obtained aspect probabilities from ABAE init , MATE , and MATE + MT .
We also experimented with a variant that only uses MILNET 's polarities and , additionally , with variants that ignore polarities and only use aspect probabilities .
Results are shown in Table 4 ( bottom ) .
The combined use of polarity and aspect information improves the retrieval of salient opinions across domains , as all model variants that use our salience formula of Equation ( 12 ) outperform the MILNET - and aspect-only baselines .
When comparing between aspect-based alternatives , we observe that the extraction accuracy correlates with the quality of aspect prediction .
In particular , ranking using MILNET + MATE + MT gives best results , with a 2.6 % increase in MAP against MILNET + MATE and 4.6 % against MIL-NET + ABAE init .
The trend persists even when MILNET polarities are ignored , although the quality of rankings is worse in this case .
Opinion Summaries
We now turn to the summarization task itself , where we compare our best performing model ( MILNET + MATE + MT ) , with and without a redundancy filter ( RD ) , against the following methods : a baseline that selects segments randomly ; a Lead baseline that only selects the leading segments from each review ; SumBasic , 5 A system 's salience ranking is individually compared against labels from each annotator and we report the average .
a generic frequency - based extractive summarizer ( Nenkova and Vanderwende , 2005 ) ; LexRank , a generic graph - based extractive summarizer ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ) ; Opinosis , a graph- based abstractive summarizer that is designed for opinion summarization ( Ganesan et al. , 2010 ) .
All extractive methods operate on the EDU level with a 100 - word budget .
For Opinosis , we tested an aspect-agnostic variant that takes every review segment for a product as input , and a variant that uses MATE 's groupings of segments to produce and concatenate aspect-specific summaries .
Table 5 presents ROUGE -1 , ROUGE - 2 and ROUGE -L F1 scores , averaged across domains .
Our model ( MILNET + MATE + MT ) significantly outperforms all comparison systems ( p < 0.05 ; paired bootstrap resampling ; Koehn 2004 ) , whilst using a redundancy filter slightly improves performance .
Assisting Opinosis with aspect predictions is beneficial , however , it remains significantly inferior to our model ( see the supplementary material for additional results ) .
We also performed a large-scale user study .
For every product in the OPOSUM test set , participants were asked to compare summaries produced by : a ( randomly selected ) human annotator , our best performing model ( MILNET + MATE + MT + RD ) , Opinosis , and the Lead baseline .
The study was conducted on the Crowdflower platform using Best-Worst Scaling ( BWS ; Louviere and Woodworth 1991 ; Louviere et al. 2015 ) , a less labourintensive alternative to paired comparisons that has been shown to produce more reliable results than rating scales ( Kiritchenko and Mohammad , 2017 ) .
We arranged every 4 - tuple of competing summaries into four triplets .
Every triplet was

Communication a bit difficult . :( shown to three crowdworkers , who were asked to decide which summary was best and which one was worst according to four criteria : Informativeness ( How much useful information about the product does the summary provide ? ) , Polarity ( How well does the summary highlight positive and negative opinions ? ) , Coherence ( How coherent and easy to read is the summary ? )
Redundancy ( How successfully does the summary avoid redundant opinions ? ) .
For every criterion , a system 's score is computed as the percentage of times it was selected as best minus the percentage of times it was selected as worst ( Orme , 2009 ) .
The scores range from - 100 ( unanimously worst ) to + 100 ( unanimously best ) and are shown in Table 6 . Participants favored our model over comparison systems across all criteria ( all differences are statistically significant at p < 0.05 using post-hoc HD Tukey tests ) .
Human summaries are generally preferred over our model , however the difference is significant only in terms of coherence ( p < 0.05 ) .
Finally , Figure 3 shows example summaries for a product from our televisions domain , produced by one of our annotators and by 3 comparison systems ( LexRank , Opinosis and our MIL - NET + MATE + MT + RD ) .
The human summary is primarily focused on aspect-relevant opinions , a characteristic that is also captured to a large extent by our method .
There is substantial overlap between extracted segments , although our redundancy filter fails to identify a few highly similar opinions ( e.g. , those relating to the picture quality ) .
The LexRank summary is inferior as it only identifies a few useful opinions , and instead selects many general or non-opinionated comments .
Lastly , the abstractive summary of Opinosis does a good job of capturing opinions about specific aspects but lacks in fluency , as it produces grammatical errors .
For additional system outputs , see supplementary material .
Conclusions
We presented a weakly supervised neural framework for aspect-based opinion summarization .
Our method combined a seeded aspect extractor that is trained under a multi-task objective without direct supervision , and a multiple instance learning sentiment predictor , to identify and extract useful comments in product reviews .
We evaluated our weakly supervised models on a new opinion summarization corpus across three subtasks , namely aspect identification , salient opinion extraction , and summary generation .
Our approach delivered significant improvements over strong baselines in each of the subtasks , while a large-scale judgment elicitation study showed that crowdworkers favor our summarizer over competitive extractive and abstractive systems .
In the future , we plan to develop a more integrated approach where aspects and sentiment orientation are jointly identified , and work with additional languages and domains .
We would also like to develop methods for abstractive opinion summarization using weak supervision signals .

We use d s ? {d C 1 , d C 2 , . . . } to denote the true domain of segment s and define a classifier that uses the vectors from our segment encoder as inputs : Aspect Top Terms Image picture color quality black bright Sound sound speaker quality bass loud Connectivity hdmi port computer input component Price price value money worth paid Apps & Interface netflix user file hulu apps Ease of Use easy remote setup user menu Customer Service paid support service week replace Size & Look size big bigger difference screen General tv bought hdtv happy problem

Table 3 : 3 The OPOSUM corpus .
Numbers in parentheses correspond to the human-annotated subset .
Opinion Polarity Aside from describing a prod- uct 's aspects , segments also express polarity ( i.e. , positive or negative sentiment ) .
We identify segment polarity with the recently proposed Mul - tiple Instance Learning Network model ( MILNET ; Angelidis and Lapata 2018 ) .
Whilst trained on freely available document- level sentiment labels , i.e. , customer ratings on a scale from 1 ( negative ) to 5 ( positive ) , MILNET learns a segment- level sentiment predictor using a hierarchical , attention - based neural architecture .

Table 4 4 ( top ) reports the results using micro-averaged F1 .
Our models outperform both variants of ABAE across domains .
ABAE init improves upon the vanilla model , affirming that informed aspect ini- tialization can facilitate the task .
The richer multi- seed representation of MATE , however , helps our model achieve a 3.2 % increase in F1 .
Further im - provements are gained by the multi-task model , which boosts performance by 2.7 % .

Table 6 : 6 Best-Worst Scaling human evaluation .
Product domain : Televisions Product name : Sony BRAVIA 46 - Inch HDTV Human Plenty of ports and settings .
Easy hookups to audio and satellite sources .
The sound is good and strong .
This TV looks very good .
and the price is even better .
The on-screen menu / options is quite nice .
and the internet apps work as expected .
The picture is clear and sharp .
which is TOO SLOW to stream HD video ...
The software and apps built into this TV .
are difficult to use and setup .
Their service is handled off shore making .
communication a bit difficult .
:(
LexRank Get a Roku or Netflix box .
I watch cable , Netflix , Hulu Plus , YouTube videos and computer movie files on it .
Sound is good much better .
DO NOT BUY !
this SONY Bravia ' Smart ' TV ... and avoid the Sony apps at all costs .
Because of these two issues , I returned the Sony TV .
Also you can change the display and sound settings on each port .
However , the streaming speed for netflix is just down right terrible .
Most of the time I just quit .
Since I do not own the cable box , So , I have the cable .
ABAE also uses a uniqueness regularization term that is not shown here and is not used in our Multi- Seed Aspect Extractor model .

While this may seem moderate , Radev et al . ( 2003 ) show that inter-annotator agreement for extractive summarization is usually lower ( K < 0.30 ) .
