Resource Creation and Evaluation of Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis in Urdu
abstract
Along with the rise of people generated content on social sites , sentiment analysis has gained more importance .
Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) is a task of identifying the sentiment at aspect level .
It has more importance than sentiment analysis from commercial point of view .
To the best of our knowledge , there is very few work on ABSA in Urdu language .
Recent work on ABSA has limitations .
Only predefined aspects are identified in a specific domain .
So our focus is on the creation and evaluation of dataset for ABSA in Urdu language which will support multiple aspects .
This dataset will provide a baseline evaluation for ABSA systems .
Introduction
We are living in a world where web interaction is increasing .
People share their emotions and express their feelings on different platforms through internet .
A lot of work has been done to obtain valuable information from these reviews .
Sentiment analysis is a task of identifying people 's emotions , feelings and opinion about a particular object from their reviews ( Khan et al. , 2018a ) .
It is divided into three levels .
Document level , Sentence level and Aspect level .
" Document level " classifies the opinion of a complete document or paragraph into positive , negative , conflict or neutral .
" Sentence level " classifies the sentiment of a sentence into positive , negative , conflict or neutral .
" Entity / aspect level "
It obtains the sentiment of a sentence at aspect ( features ) level ( Patil and Yalagi , 2016 ) .
Sentiment analysis has obtained importance in different areas like business intelligence and social media monitoring etc .
Another area of interest is monitoring political data ( Gold et al. , 2018 ) .
There has been very little research in the Urdu language since it is a low resourced language ( Syed et al. , 2010 )
Urdu has different morphological structures and linguistic features , so sentiment analysis intended for the English language ca n't be utilized for this language ( Khan et al. , 2018a ) , ( Syed et al. , 2010 ) .
Many approaches and difficulties are discussed for the English language but very few for the Urdu language ( El - Masri et al. , 2017 ) .
Urdu is a mixture of many languages , so one of the challenging tasks is to handle different languages with their orientation ( Khan et al. , 2018 b ) .
Aspect based sentiment analysis is a process of extracting the opinions expressed about a specific entity .
The sentiment analysis task becomes more challenging when there are multiple sentiments in a review on different aspects ( Al - Smadi et al. , 2015 ) .
Recently , the sentiment analysis research has moved towards having all the more fine- grained approaches thinking about the Urdu language aspects .
But still , Urdu language is struggling at the aspect level .
Recent work on the Urdu language at aspect level is not much more fine - grained as they deal only 4 predefined aspects .
( ul Haq et al. , 2020 ) .
We aim to improve the current work by dealing the multiple aspects .
An aspect can be a single word ( e.g. , Runs ) or multi word ( e.g. , T 20 Series ) .
A sentence may have one or more aspects that belongs to the same category .
For this purpose clustering is used to group the related aspects into a single cluster .
In this way we have a more finegrained work at aspect level .
We present a corpus of " Cricket " and " Football " domain in the Urdu language for ABSA .
Which will provide a baseline evaluation and can further used for measuring the results of ABSA systems .
The rest of the paper is sorted out as follows .
Section 2 describes related work .
Section 3 contains a problem statement .
Section 4 has a proposed methodology .
Section 5 contains a description of the data collection and annotation procedure .
Section 6 provides information on guidelines for annotation .
Section 7 has a conclusion .
Related work
The task of ABSA was first presented by SemEval in 2014 for English language ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) .
They provided data set of restaurant and laptop reviews for training and testing .
( Al - Smadi et al. , 2015 ) a benchmark dataset of Arabic language for aspect based sentiment analysis named as " HAAD " is prepared by them .
They manually annotated the data at sentence level .
Annotators used an online tool ( BRAT ) for annotation .
This dataset provides the baseline evaluation to the four tasks i.e. ; Aspect Extraction , Aspect Polarity , Aspect Category identification , Aspect Category Polarity .
( Rehman and Bajwa , 2016 ) a lexicon based approach has been adapted for sentiment analysis in Urdu language .
They collected 124 comments from news sites .
In preprocessing , tokens were generated .
Polarity of each word is calculated by comparing with the sentiment lexicon .
Accuracy of their approach was round about 66 % .
( Arif et al. , 2016 ) performed analysis on roman Urdu and provided the results by applying different classifiers on the dataset .
Machine learning algorithms are applied on selected features for binary classification .
Multiple classifiers are used on sparse matrix to evaluate the performance .
Tf -idf is the term weighting model which gives the best overall accuracy with machine learning classifiers .
SVM performs better then all of the classifiers by giving 96 % accuracy .
Two datasets of low resourced languages Catalan and Basque for aspect level sentiment analysis are introduced by ( Barnes et al. , 2018 ) .
They performed tokenization , POS tagging and Lemmatization using Lxa-pipes .
They trained a linear svc classifier for the classification of the polarity of opinion expressions .
They trained a CRF on the standard features for the extraction of opinion holders , targets and expressions .
For evaluation , 10 fold cross validation is used on 80 % of data and F1 is used for extraction and classification .
( Apidianaki et al. , 2016 ) this paper describes the data collection procedure and annotation guidelines .
To increase the applicability and comparability of system , SemEval - 2015 Task for English guidelines are used for annotation .
They used different systems to identify three types of information ( aspect category , opinion target expression and sentiment polarity ) .
The categories returned by a framework are compared with gold annotations and Precision , Recall and F1 is measured .
( Nawaz et al. , 2019 ) a segregational approach has been used for identifying the aspects .
They introduced a technique which is consisted on two phases .
1st phase consist on extraction and grouping of target related words for a given objective by utilizing Normalized Google distance ( NGD ) .
Aspects are identified using POS tagger which is modified .
In 2nd phase , they reduced the redundant and irrelevant aspects using Concept Net .
They have applied this strategy on each word in an opinionated sentence to identify either it is a aspect word or non-aspect word .
( Brychc ? n et al. , 2014 ) participated in the task of SemEval task 4 2014 .
They have used machine learning approach for constrained system and for unconstrained system they expand the constrained feature set by LDA , semantic spaces and semantic dictionaries .
They compared their results with best and averages as well as with the baseline of SemEval and found that performance of their system is quite well .
( Zhao et al. , 2014 ) worked on introducing a new annotation scheme and developed corpus for Chinese sentiment analysis .
Elements of their annotation scheme are target entity , aspect , implicit aspect , polarity expression , modifier , Negation , polarity , transition word and compare .
For sentiment analysis task , 3 main most relevant elements are ?object , description , polarity ?.
In their annotation scheme , 1st three elements are for object then 4 - 6 are for description and last three elements can be used to compute polarity .
They performed an experiment on target -aspect pair extraction task .
For cross validation , they used 10 fold on the new corpus .
They applied Ml algorithms and reached the accuracy at 81.80 % .
( Clematide et al. , 2012 ) worked on the creation of Multilayered Reference corpus for German sentiment analysis .
They used layered approach for annotation .
At layer 1 , polarity and subjectivity / objectivity is analyzed .
At layer 2 , they analyzed word and phrase-level annotation .
At layer 3 , they focused on the annotation of expression -level .
Each layer had been analyzed by multiple annotators .
To ensure the quality of data , they also calculated the inter-annotator agreement .
( Kumar et al. , 2018 ) worked on the development of Hindi-English corpus for aggression annotation .
They defined an annotation scheme in which they divided aggression tag sets into three levels ( toplevel ) .
Overtly aggressive , covertly aggressive and non aggressive .
Each of the top level has further two attributes - discursive role and discursive effect .
Discursive effects have 10 kind ( s ) and are based on the type of aggression .
They used a hierarchical approach of 3 top- level tags and 10 level 2 tags for annotation .
( K?l?nc ?et al. , 2017 ) worked on the creation of dataset named as TTC 3600 .
Stemming is performed on the primary data .
For feature selection , two methodologies are used .
Correlationbased feature selection and Attribute ranking based feature selection .
Thinking about the high dimensionality and over fitting characteristics five classifiers were selected for text categorization ( NB , SVM , K-NN , j 48 and RF ) .
Three different versions of TTC 3600 ( F5 - DS , F7 - DS and Zemb - DS ) were created by removing stop words and using stemmer .
RF has the highest accuracy on all the datasets as compared to other classifiers .
RF gives the best accuracy 91.03 % on Zemb - DS dataset after applying ARFS .
( Tocoglu and Alpkocak , 2018 ) a dataset for emotion analysis in Turkish language has been prepared by them named as TREMO .
They performed a validation process to validate the raw dataset and got two datasets .
In preprocessing , they performed Fixed prefix ( F5 ) stemming and Zemberek stemming .
Which resulted four versions of dataset , F5 , F5 -V , Z and Z-V .
For feature selection , they used mutual information .
Then they applied four different classifiers ( CNB , J48 , RF and SVM ) on all types of datasets and evaluate the performance by Precision , Recall , accuracy and F-measure .
Result of SVM was better than the others .
Statement of the problem Rather than classifying the complete sentiment of a sentence into positive , negative or neutral , ABSA allows us to associate specific sentiment with different aspects of a product .
Since Urdu language is a low-resourced language , there is very little work on ABSA , especially in Urdu language ( ul Haq et al. , 2020 ) .
Unavailability of Urdu dataset for aspect based sentiment analysis leads to constructing a benchmark dataset of a specific domain .
We aim to create a benchmark corpus to facilitate the ABSA systems .
Annotation will be performed according to the guidelines of SemEval and performance is measured by using different Machine Learning approaches .
Proposed Methodology
As our proposed methodology can be seen from figure 1 . We crawled Urdu tweets of Cricket and Football domain from Twitter using Twitter API 's .
Then we performed preprocessing on raw data .
In preprocessing , special characters , hashtags , links and punctuation marks are removed using Sci Kit Learn and regular expressions .
After preprocessing , we prepared annotation guidelines for annotating the data .
These guidelines are according to the standards of SemEval .
After preparing guidelines for annotation , three annotators will manually annotate the dataset .
In the annotation process , four types of information have to identify , i.e. , aspect , aspect category , aspect polarity and aspect category polarity .
Annotators will identify aspects and assign polarity .
To ensure the quality of the dataset , we will compute the inter-annotator agreement .
For feature extraction , we will apply Tf-idf vectorizer and n-gram models .
Next , we will apply Baseline models of Machine Learning like naive Bayes , Random Forest , KNN .
Then we will evaluate the performance by Precision , Recall and F1 measure .
Data Collection and Annotation
This dataset is consists of two different domains " Cricket " and " football " .
We collected 7000 tweets of cricket domain and 3000 tweets of football domain from Twitter using Twitter API 's .
Three annotators will manually annotate the data .
They have to identify four types of information , which is discussed in section 4 .
Data description
This section describes the data statistics that have been annotated in the developed corpus .
Table 1 shows the aspect category statistics .
Annotation guidelines Initially , we have prepared some guidelines to annotate the data .
The aim of these guidelines is to identify the aspects and sentiment polarity in sentences .
We have to identify four types of information for annotation .
? Aspect / Entity ?
If an aspect term occurs more than once , then annotate all of them . ?
If an identified aspect is misspelled , it should be annotated .
?
Annotate aspect terms even if it is in quotation marks or brackets .
?
Implicit aspects are not annotated .
Guidelines for Aspect polarity Assign polarity to each aspect from these ( positive , negative , neutral and conflict ) .
?
When a sentence contains positive sentiment then assign positive polarity . ?
When a sentence contains negative sentiment then assign negative polarity .
?
Assign neutral polarity to aspect when an aspect is neither positive nor negative .
?
When a sentence has more than 1 aspect and each aspect have a contrast among polarities then assign conflict polarity to the aspects .
Guidelines for Aspect Category Identify the aspect category from these predefined categories .
Assign " other " category to those aspects which have implicit aspect .
? management ? performance
? inquiry commission ? general ? other
Guidelines for Aspect Category Polarity
It is same as Aspect term polarity .
Assign the polarity from ( positive , negative , neutral and conflict ) .
Conclusion
In this paper , we have presented a benchmark corpus for ABSA in the Urdu language .
This dataset has been prepared to cover different areas of research .
It will facilitate researchers because we are covering four tasks of sentiment analysis .
Which can be further used in the future by adding more domains .
We believe that it will be very beneficial for the researcher community because we work in a different language and a specific domain .
In future , we aim to improve our work by applying different techniques for feature extraction .
We also plan to explore more machine learning algorithms and neural networks for these tasks .
