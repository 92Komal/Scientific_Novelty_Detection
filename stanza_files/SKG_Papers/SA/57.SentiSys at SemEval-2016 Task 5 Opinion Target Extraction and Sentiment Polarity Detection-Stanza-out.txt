Introduction
Classifying opinion texts at document or sentence levels is not sufficient for applications which need to identify the opinion targets .
Even if the document is about one entity , many applications need to determine the opinion about each aspect of the entity .
A user may express a positive opinion towards a restaurant , but he may have a negative opinion towards some aspects as the ambiance .
Therefore , we need to identify the aspects and determine whether the sentiment is positive , negative or neutral towards each one .
This task is called Aspect- Based Sentiment Analysis or Feature - Based opinion mining as called in the early work ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) .
Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis is composed of four subtasks :
Opinion Target Expression Extraction Opinion Target Expression is a linguistic expression used in a given text to refer to an aspect of the reviewed entity .
This subtask aims at identifying all the aspect terms present in a given set of sentences with pre-identified entities such as restaurants , laptops .
An opinion target names a particular aspect of the target entity .
For example : " I liked the service and the staff , but not the food " " The hard disk is very noisy "
The service , staff and food are opinion target expressions .
hard disk is multi-word opinion target expression which will be treated as a single term .
Aspect Sentiment Detection Each identified opinion target has to be assigned to one of the following polarity labels : positive , negative or neutral .
For example : Input : " I hated their fajitas , but their salads were great "
Output : { fajitas : negative , salads : positive }
Aspect Category Detection
This subtask aims at identifying the aspect categories discussed in a given sentence from a predefined set of aspect categories such as price and food .
Aspect categories are typically coarser than the opinion targets , and they do not necessarily occur as terms in a given sentence .
For example , given the set of aspect categories of restaurant entity { food , service , price , am-biance } : " The restaurant was too expensive "
The aspect category is { price } .
" The restaurant was expensive , but the menu was great "
The aspect categories are { price , food} .
Aspect Category Polarity Given a set of pre-identified aspect categories such as { food , price} , this subtask aims at determining the polarity of each aspect category .
For example : " The restaurant was too expensive " { price : negative }
" The restaurant was expensive , but the menu was great " { price : negative , food : positive }
In this paper , we focus on Opinion Target Extraction ( OTE ) and Sentiment Polarity towards a target or a category .
The description of each subtask is provided by ABSA organizers ( Pontiki et al. , 2016 ) .
For OTE , a CRF model is proposed with several groups of features including syntactic and lexical features .
For polarity detection , a logistic regression classifier is trained with the weighting schema for positive and negative labels and several groups of features are extracted including lexical , syntactic , semantic and sentiment lexicon features .
The rest of this paper is organised as follows .
Section 2 outlines existing work in target extraction and polarity detection .
Section 3 describes our system for opinion target extraction .
Polarity detection is presented in Section 4 .
Section 5 shows the conclusion and the future work .
Related Work Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis consists of several subtasks .
Some studies have proposed different methods for aspect detection and sentiment polarity analysis , others have proposed joint models in order to obtain the aspect and their polarities from the same model , these last models are generally unsupervised .
The early work on opinion target detection from on -line reviews presented by ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) used association rule mining based on Apriori algorithm ( Agrawal and Srikant , 1994 ) to extract frequent noun phrases as product features .
For polarity detection , they used two seed sets of 30 positive and negative adjectives , then WordNet has been used to find and add the synonyms of the seed words .
Infrequent product features or opinion targets had been processed by finding the noun related to an opinionated word .
Opinion Digger ( Moghaddam and Ester , 2010 ) also used the Apriori algorithm to extract the frequent opinion targets .
The kNN algorithm is applied to estimate the aspect rating scaling from 1 to 5 stands for ( Excellent , Good , Average , Poor , Terrible ) .
Supervised methods use normally Conditional Random Fields ( CRF ) or Hidden Markov models ( HMM ) .
( Jin and Ho , 2009 ) applied a HMM model to extract opinion targets using the words and their part- of-speech tags in order to learn a model , then unsupervised algorithm for determining the opinion targets polarity using the nearest opinion word to the opinion target and taking into account the polarity reversal words ( such as not ) .
A CRF model was used by ( Jakob and Gurevych , 2010 ) with the following features : tokens , POS tags , syntactic dependency ( if the opinion target has a relation with the opinionated word ) , word distance ( the distance between the word in the closest noun phrase and the opinionated word ) , and opinion sentences ( each token in the sentence containing an opinionated expression is labeled by this feature ) , the input of this method is also the opinionated expressions , they use these expressions for predicting the opinion target polarity using dependency parsing for retrieving the pair target - expression from the training set .
( Hamdan et al. , 2014 ; Hamdan et al. , 2015a ) also applied a CRF model with different features .
Unsupervised methods based on LDA ( Latent Dirichlet allocation ) have been proposed .
( Brody and Elhadad , 2010 ) used LDA to figure out the opinion targets , determined the number of topics by applying a clustering method , then they used a similar method proposed by ( Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown , 1997 ) to extract the conjunctive adjectives , but not the disjunctive due to the specificity of the domain .
( Lin et al. , 2012 ) proposed Joint model of Sentiment and Topic ( JST ) which extends the state- ofthe - art topic model ( LDA ) by adding a sentiment layer , this model is fully unsupervised and it can detect sentiment and topic simultaneously .
( Wei and Gulla , 2010 ) modeled the hierarchical relation between product aspects .
They defined Sentiment Ontology Tree ( SOT ) to formulate the knowledge of hierarchical relationships among product attributes and tackled the problem of sentiment analysis as a hierarchical classification problem .
Unsupervised hierarchical aspect Sentiment model ( HASM ) was proposed by ( Kim et al. , 2013 ) to discover a hierarchical structure of aspect-based sentiments from unlabeled online reviews .
Opinion Target Expression ( OTE )
The objective of opinion target extraction is to extract all opinion target expressions in a restaurant review , opinion target could be a word or multiple words .
This extraction consists of the following steps : 1 . Review Segmentation
This step segments each review into sentences .
In restaurant dataset , we already have the sentences .
Sentence Tokenizing Each sentence is tokenized to get the terms .
One can consider the spaces as separators or use a more complex tokenizer .
We tokenize each sentence using NTLK tokenizer 1 which extracts the words , numbers and punctuations .

Sentence Tagging
Each term in the sentence should be tagged in order to be presented to a tagging classifier .
We choose the IOB notation for representing each sentence in the review .
Therefore , we distinguish the terms at the Beginning , the Inside and the Outside of opinion target expression .
For example , for the following review sentence : " But the staff was so horrible to us . "
Where staff is opinion target .
The tag of each term will be :
Feature Extraction
This is the main step of opinion target extraction .
For representing each term , we extract the following features : ?
The term itself .
? POS : We use NLTK parser 2 to attach a part of speech tag to each term .
? word shape : the shape of each character in the word ( capital letter , small letter , digit , punctuation , other symbol ) ? word type : the type of the word ( uppercase , digit , symbol , combination ) ? Prefixes ( all prefixes having length between one to four ) .
?
Suffixes ( all suffixes having length between one to four ) .
?
Stop word : if the word is a stop word or not .
In addition to the previous features , we extract for each term the following features : ?
The two preceding and three subsequent terms of the actual term . ?
The value of each two successive features in the the range - 2,2 ( the previous and subsequent two terms of actual term ) for the following features : term , word POS , word shape , word type .
For example , for POS feature we extract : pos [ - 2 ] - pos [ - 1 ] =DT - JJ pos [ -1 ] - pos [ 0 ] =JJ - NN pos[0 ] - pos [ 1 ] =NN - , pos [ 1 ] - pos [ 2 ] = , -C ?
We also extract the value of each three successive features in the the range - 1,1 for the two features : term POS and term .
For example , for the feature term we extract : term [ - 2 ] - term [ - 1 ] - term [ 0 ] =a-good-place term [ - 1] - term [ 0 ] - term [ 1 ] =good-place - ,
Training Method we have used a Conditional Random Fields ( CRF ) which receives the feature representation of each term in each sentence and builds a tagging model in order to use it for predicting the tags of the new sentences .
Experiments
The data set is extracted restaurant reviews , provided by SemEval 2016 ABSA organisers ( Pontiki et al. , 2016 ) where each review is composed of several sentences and each sentence may contain several OTEs .
CRFsuite tool is used for this experiment .
This tool is fast in training and tagging ( Okazaki , 2007 ) .
Our submission is ranked second among the constrained systems and sixth over all 19 systems with the F1 score .
Table 2 shows the result of our system .
Experiment F1 Score Our System 66.545 Baseline 44.071 Table 1 . The results of OTE slot .
Sentiment Polarity
For a given set of aspect terms within a sentence , we determine whether the polarity of each aspect term is positive , negative or neutral .
For example , the system should extract the polarity of fajitas and salads in the following sentence : " I hated their fajitas , but their salads were great " , fajitas : negative and salads : positive .
This sub-task can be seen as sentence level or phrase level sentiment Analysis .
We should determine the polarity , which could be positive , negative , neutral .
We use the system described by ( Hamdan et al. , 2015 b ) .
Thus , We propose to use a logistic regression classifier with weighting schema of positive and negative labels with the following features : - Word n-grams Features Unigrams and bigrams are extracted for each word in the text without any stemming or stop-word removing , all terms with occurrence less than 3 are removed from the feature space .
- Sentiment Lexicon - based Features
The system extracts four features from the manually constructed lexicons ( Bing Liu Lexicon ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) and MPQA subjectivity Lexicon ( Wilson et al. , 2005 ) ) and six features from the automatic ones ( NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon ( Mohammad , 2012 ) , Sentiment Lexicon ( Hamdan et al. , 2015 b ) ) .
For each text the number of positive words , the number of negative ones , the number of positive words divided by the number of negative ones and the polarity of the last word are extracted from manual constructed lexicons .
In addition to the sum of the positive scores and the sum of the negative scores from the automatic constructed lexicons .
- Negation Features
The rule- based algorithm presented in Christopher Potts ' Sentiment Symposium Tutorial is implemented .
This algorithm appends a negation suffix to all words that appear within a negation scope which is determined by the negation key and a certain punctuation .
All these words are added to the feature space .
- Brown Cluster Features
Each word in the text is mapped to its cluster in Brown clusters , 1000 features are added to feature space where each feature represents the number of words in the text mapped to each cluster .
The 1000 clusters is provided in Twitter Word Clusters of CMU ARK group which were constructed from approximately 56 million tweets .
- Category Feature
We also added the category of each OTE as a feature to the feature space .
Experiments
We trained a L1 - regularized Logistic regression classifier implemented in LIBLINEAR , which has given good results in several papers ( Hamdan et al. , 2015 b ) ( Hamdan et al. , 2015 a ) .
The classifier is trained on the training data set using the previous features with the three polarities ( positive , negative , and neutral ) as labels .
A weighting schema is adapted for each class , we use the weighting option - wi which enables a use of different cost parameter C for different classes .
Since the training data is unbalanced , this weighting schema adjusts the probability of each label .
Thus we tuned the classifier in adjusting the cost parameter C of Logistic Regression , weight wpos of positive class and weight wneg of negative class .
We used the 1/10 of training data set for tuning the three parameters in Laptop reviews , all combinations of C in range 0.1 to to 4 by step 0.1 , wpos in range 1 to 8 by step 0.1 , wneg in range 1 to 8 by step 0.1 are tested .
The combination C=0.3 , textitwpos = 1.2 , wneg = 1.9 have been chosen .
Table 2 shows the results of our system on the Laptop data set .
Our system is ranked eighth over 22 submissions .
