SLSA : A Sentiment Lexicon for Standard Arabic
abstract
Sentiment analysis has been a major area of interest , for which the existence of highquality resources is crucial .
In Arabic , there is a reasonable number of sentiment lexicons but with major deficiencies .
The paper presents a large-scale Standard Arabic Sentiment Lexicon ( SLSA ) that is publicly available for free and avoids the deficiencies in the current resources .
SLSA has the highest up - to - date reported coverage .
The construction of SLSA is based on linking the lexicon of AraMorph with Sen-tiWordNet along with a few heuristics and powerful back - off .
SLSA shows a relative improvement of 37.8 % over a state - of - theart lexicon when tested for accuracy .
It also outperforms it by an absolute 3.5 % of F1 - score when tested for sentiment analysis .
Introduction Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying and extracting subjective information using Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) .
It helps identifying opinions and extracting relevant information that lies behind the analyzed data .
Sentiment analysis has received enormous interest in NLP , and in particular in the context of web content .
This includes social media , blogs , discussions , reviews and advertisement .
While there has been extensive work on sentiment analysis in English and other languages of interest , less work has been done for Arabic .
A major concern in Arabic NLP is the morphological complexity of the language along with the limited number of resources , corpora in particular .
The goal of this work is to build a publicly available large-scale Sentiment Lexicon for Standard Arabic ( SLSA ) .
For every lemma and partof-speech ( POS ) combination that exists in a large Standard Arabic lexicon , SLSA assigns the scores of three sentiment labels : positive , negative and objective , in addition to the English gloss .
The positive and negative scores range between zero and one , while the objective score is defined as 1 -( positive score + negative score ) .
The existence of SLSA is valuable to the field of Arabic sentiment analysis , which is expected to receive considerable focus during the current decade .
SLSA is the first sentiment lexicon for Arabic to combine the following four strengths .
High coverage SLSA lists the sentiment of about 35,000 lemma and POS combinations , which is the highest coverage reported for Standard Arabic sentiment lexicons .
High quality
Unlike many of the current lexicons whose construction is based on semi-supervised learning and heuristic - based approaches , SLSA is not constructed via machine learning models , while the use of heuristics is minimal .
Richness
As opposed to sparse surface - based lexicons , SLSA is a lemma-based resource that attaches POS and English gloss information to each lemma , where the information of a lemma is applicable to its inflected forms .
This makes the lexicon more useful when used by other research .
Public Availability SLSA is based on free resources and is publicly available for free .

Related Work Work on building Arabic sentiment lexicons mainly falls into two categories : 1 ) linking an Arabic sentiment lexicon with an English one , and 2 ) applying semi-supervised or supervised learning techniques on Arabic resources .
We summarize these two types in turn .
We start with a survey of work based on translation , which our work falls into as well .
The most similar work to the one presented in this paper is ArSenL ( Badaro et al. , 2014 ) .
ArSenL is considered the first publicly available largescale Standard Arabic sentiment lexicon .
It was constructed using a combination of SentiWordNet ( Baccianella et al. , 2010 ) , Arabic WordNet ( Black et al. , 2006 ) and SAMA ( Graff et al. , 2009 ) .
Ar - SenL outperforms the state- of- the - art Arabic sentiment lexicons .
However , we show that SLSA has better coverage and quality .
Moreover , Ar- SenL uses SAMA which is not publicly available for free , as opposed to SLSA which is based on free resources .
Another similar work to ArSenL is the resource developed by Alhazmi et al . ( 2013 ) .
They linked the Arabic WordNet to SentiWordNet via the provided synset offset information .
However , the constructed lexicon has a limited coverage of nearly 10 K lemmas , which makes it not very useful for further applications .
Abdul - Mageed and Diab ( 2014 ) presented SANA , a subjectivity and sentiment lexicon for Arabic .
The lexicon combines pre-existing lexicons and involves automatic machine translation , manual annotations and gloss matching across several resources such as THARWA and SAMA .
SANA includes about 225 K entries , where many of them are duplicates , inflected or not diacritized , which makes the resource noisy and less useable .
Additionally , the automatic translation does not utilize the POS information , which affects the quality of the resource .
Other work that follows the translation approach includes the one presented by El-Halees ( 2011 ) where SentiStrength ( Thelwall et al. , 2010 ) was translated using a dictionary along with manual correction .
Another instance is SIFAAT ( Abdul - Mageed and Diab , 2012 ) , an earlier version of SANA but with more reliance on translation .
Another lexicon was built by Elarnaoty et al . ( 2012 ) who manually translated the MPQA lexicon ( Wilson et al. , 2005 ) .
The common aspect among those resources is the lack of adequate coverage and quality .
Mobarz et al. ( 2011 ) created a sentiment Arabic lexical Semantic Database ( SentiRDI ) by using a dictionary - based approach .
The database has many inflected forms , i.e. , it is not lemma-based .
Moreover , the authors reported insufficient quality and plan to try other alternatives .
We now turn to work based entirely on Arabic resources .
Mahyoub et al. ( 2014 ) created an Arabic sentiment lexicon that assigns sentiment scores to the words in Arabic WordNet using a lexiconbased approach .
The lexicon was initially based on a few words and then expanded by exploiting synset relations in a semi-supervised learning manner .
However , the lexicon is limited to about 23 k lemmas and is not publicly available .
Another Arabic sentiment lexicon was created by Elhawary and Elfeky ( 2010 ) .
The lexicon was built using a similarity graph where the edges have similarity scores .
A major drawback is the low coverage of the lexicon .
Moreover , expanding the graph requires a huge corpus with polarity and semantic annotations and adds more sparsity .
Approach Following the example of ArSenL ( Badaro et al. , 2014 ) , SLSA is constructed by linking the lexicon of an Arabic morphological analyzer with Senti-WordNet ( Baccianella et al. , 2010 ) . Unlike Ar-SenL , SLSA uses AraMorph ( Buckwalter , 2004 ) , a morphological analyzer for Standard Arabic .
An AraMorph entry represents a morpheme and contains the surface , lemma , part of speech ( POS ) , and gloss information .
The gloss information consists of a list of gloss terms , each of which contains one or more words ( such as " time limit / end " ) .
On the other side , SentiWordNet is a large-scale sentiment lexicon for English that assigns sentiment scores ( positive , negative and objective ) to the synsets in English WordNet ( Miller et al. , 1990 ) along with the POS and gloss information .
Upon linking the two resources , the sentiment scores in SentiWordNet are applied to the entries of AraMorph to construct SLSA .
The question this paper addresses is how to link these two resources , and we present a new linking algorithm compared to that used by ArSenL , with improved performance .
Preparing the Resources
It might seem intuitive to join the entries of AraMorph and SentiWordNet based on their glosses , but this does not work as expected .
AraMorph and SentiWordNet were developed for different reasons and have different gloss structures ( synonyms in AraMorph versus detailed descriptions in SentiWordNet ) .
Mapping the glosses is one of the major bottlenecks in ArSenL , which is not able to find a match for 24 % of the entries in SAMA .
Instead , we link the two resources by relating the glosses of AraMorph to the synset terms in SentiWordNet .
Additionally , we take POS into consideration as the glosses and synset terms might not be enough to disambiguate an entry .
Next , we discuss the preparation steps that allow for the linking of the resources .
Cleaning - up AraMorph Some POS and lemma decisions in AraMorph are erroneous or not optimal .
For example , some entries are assigned wrong POS tags , such as the NO FUNC cases , or have inconsistent spellings of the lemmas .
Also , some adverbs are redundant as they have the same lemma as an adjective .
Accordingly , we cleaned up AraMorph in a way that allows for a better linking with SentiWordNet .
The cleaned - up AraMorph is closer to SAMA ( used in ArSenL ) , which is itself a modified version of AraMorph .
Practically , SAMA can replace AraMorph .
However , the integration of AraMorph allows the lexicon to be publicly available for free , which SAMA prohibits .
Gloss Normalization
Since the entries in AraMorph are bound to stems , the English glosses are inflected for number .
As a result , we lemmatize the English glosses in AraMorph in order to be able to match to the synset terms in SentiWordNet .
The lemmatization is done using Stanford CoreNLP Natural Language Processing Toolkit ( Manning et al. , 2014 ) .
Additionally , we remove from the glosses any descriptive text between parentheses , as well as the stop words be , a , an and the ( unless be is the actual lemma of the AraMorph gloss ) .
Moreover , if any of the lemmatized words in an AraMorph gloss does not match any of the synset terms in SentiWordNet and has a regular morphological derivation , the effect of the derivation is removed if the removal results in an existing synset term , e.g. , voluntariness is converted to voluntary and orientalization becomes orientalize .
We created the list of the derivational patterns manually by examining AraMorph glosses .
POS Mapping AraMorph has a rich POS tagset , while SentiWordNet has only four tags corresponding to nouns , adjectives , adverbs and verbs .
Accordingly , AraMorph POS tags are mapped to the four tags in SentiWordNet .
Some AraMorph POS types , such as particles , pronouns and prepositions , do not map to any SentiWord - Net tags , and we exclude them as they have zero polarity scores , by definition .
AraMorph Rearrangement
We collapse all the entries in AraMorph that have the same ( lemma , POS ) pair , and the English glosses become the union of the normalized glosses before the collapse .
For example , a lemma might appear in two entries with two POS tags ; VERB PERFECT and VERB IMPERFECT .
After the preparation , the POS tags in both entries become the same ( VERB ) , and the two entries collapse into one entry whose gloss is the union of the lemmatized past-tense and present-tense glosses .
Figure 1 shows a sample of AraMorph before and after the preparation process ( the Arabic transliteration is in the Buckwalter scheme ( Buckwalter , 2004 ) ) .
SentiWordNet Rearrangement
We extract all the unique combinations of synset terms and POS tags in SentiWordNet , while the indices of the synset terms are stripped off .
However , since a synset term might appear in different synsets un - der the same POS with different indices and sentiment scores , the sentiment scores of an extracted entry is calculated as the average of all the sentiment scores that appear with the corresponding synset term and POS .
Figure 2 shows a sample of SentiWordNet before and after the preparation process . ) and the processed version ( the lower table ) .
The unique combinations of the synset terms and POS tags are extracted , where the sentiment scores of the extracted entries are the average of the scores in the contributing ones .

Linking the Resources
We start out by creating a link between an AraMorph entry and a SentiWordNet entry if any of the AraMorph one - word gloss terms and the POS match the SentiWordNet .
Upon linking , we assign the AraMorph entry the sentiment scores of the matching one in SentiWordNet .
The linking condition above applies successfully to 83.6 % of the entries in AraMorph .
If the condition does not apply , we relax it to allow for a more lenient POS agreement where NOUN and ADJ POS tags are used interchangeably , while the VERB entries in AraMorph become matchable with the ADJ ones in SentiWordNet .
The reasons behind the decisions above are that AraMorph has hundreds of cases where the same lemma appears as NOUN and ADJ , while it is frequent that AraMorph assigns an adjectival gloss ( preceded by be ) to VERB entries .
The relaxed condition enables linking an additional 6.7 % of AraMorph entries .
If the relaxed condition is still not applicable for an AraMorph entry , the linking condition becomes more lenient by completely ignoring the POS agreement .
The sentiment scores in that case become the average of the sentiment scores of the corresponding synset term across all the POS types .
The latter condition allows matching additional 0.6 % of AraMorph entries .
It might happen that none of the one-word gloss terms matches a synset term , or the gloss does not have any one - word gloss terms .
In such a case , we consider multi-word gloss terms .
We first remove the stop words , and then we test the relaxed condition on each word separately , starting with the shortest terms first .
The process succeeds if a match could be established for all the words in a gloss term , and the sentiment scores become the average sentiment scores of the matching synset terms .
The relaxed condition on multi-word terms solves additional 7.9 % of the cases .
Finally , if no match could be established across all the different gloss terms ( 1.2 % of the entries ) , default neutral sentiment scores are assigned .
The analysis of such cases is discussed in section 4 .
Sometimes , a multi-word gloss term consists of words that denote excess ( e.g. , most and more ) , scarcity ( e.g. , less and few ) or negation ( e.g. , not ) .
We do not match such words to synset terms .
Instead , they affect the polarity scores ; we double the score , halve the score and swap the sign , respectively .
We created the list of such words manually by examining AraMorph glosses .
Figure 3 illustrates the linking process between a sample of the processed AraMorph with a sample of the processed SentiWordNet , resulting in the construction of SLSA .
The final SLSA lexicon consists of 34,821 entries .
The counts of the different POS tags in SLSA along with the percentages of the different sentiment classes are reported in Table 1 , while examples from the final lexicon are listed in Table 2 . tators to judge the correctness of the values in the two lexicons .
ArSenL may have several sentiment values for the same entry , each with its own confidence score , so we used the sentiment values with the highest confidence score ( averaged in the case of multiple answers ) .
Since judging the values as real numbers is hard for humans , we map the sentiment scores into three classes of intensity ( zero , up to 0.55 and above 0.55 ) .
An entry is correct only if the values of the positive and negative polarity classes are both correct .
Each entry was judged by two annotators ( without knowing its origin ) .
They had to discuss and come to an agreement in the cases of disagreement ( about 15 % of the cases ) .
SLSA and ArSenL have the exact same scores in 58.2 % of the cases , which increases to 83.5 % when mapping to the intensity classes .
Extrinsic Evaluation
We conduct an extrinsic evaluation of SLSA on the task of sentiment analysis where a subjective sentence is classified to be either positive or negative .
The performance is compared to that of Ar- SenL .
We use an evaluation setup similar to the one described in ( Badaro et al. , 2014 ) using the corpus developed by Abdul- Mageed et al . ( 2011 ) .
The corpus involves 400 documents from the Penn Arabic Treebank ( part 1 version 3 ) ( Maamouri et al. , 2004 ) where the sentences are tagged as objective , subjective - positive , subjective - negative and subjective -neutral .
The evaluation only involves the sentences tagged as subjective -positive and subjective -negative .
Random 80 % of the sentences are used for training , while the rest are left for testing .
We train a Support Vector Machines classifier , through LIBSVM ( Chang and Lin , 2011 ) , using sentence vectors of three features representing the averages of the positive scores , negative scores and objective scores of the non-stop words in the sentence divided by the count of the underlying words .
The scores are obtained by querying the lexicon using the lemma and POS information .
We optimize the classification to obtain the best F1 - score based on five - fold cross validation on the training set using different SVM kernels and parameters .
Polynomial kernels give the best weighted - average F1 - score 3 of 68.6 % ( using SLSA ) , which is an absolute 0.2 % improvement over linear kernels .
Table 3 lists the precision , recall and F1 - score of a majority baseline ( subjective - negative ) , SLSA and ArSenL .
SLSA provides absolute weighted - average F1 - score improvements of 22.9 % and 3.5 % over the baseline and ArSenL , respectively .
Conclusion and Future Work
We have presented a publicly available large-scale Standard Arabic Sentiment Lexicon ( SLSA ) that avoids the deficiencies in the current lexicons .
The construction of SLSA is based on linking the lexicon of AraMorph with SentiWordNet along with a few heuristics and powerful back - off .
SLSA has the highest up - to - date reported coverage .
SLSA shows a relative improvement of 37.8 % over a state - of - the - art lexicon when tested for accuracy .
It also outperforms it by an absolute 3.5 % of F1 score when tested for sentiment analysis .
The future plans include manually correcting SLSA to reach a nearly 100 % accuracy .
Additionally , the work will be extended to the Arabic dialects for which AraMorph - like morphological analyzers are available .
We also plan to study the cases where English and Arabic translations have different sentiments due to cultural differences .
Figure 1 : 1 Figure 1 : A sample of the original AraMorph ( the upper table ) and the processed version ( the lower table ) .
The glosses are normalized , while the POS tags are mapped to the tags in SentiWordNet .
The entries of the same POS and lemma combinations are then collapsed , where their gloss becomes the union of the normalized glosses in the collapsed entries .
