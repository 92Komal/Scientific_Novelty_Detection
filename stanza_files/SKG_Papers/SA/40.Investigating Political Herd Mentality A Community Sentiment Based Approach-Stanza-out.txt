Investigating Political Herd Mentality : A Community Sentiment Based Approach
abstract
Analyzing polarities and sentiments inherent in political speeches and debates poses an important problem today .
This experiment aims to address this issue by analyzing publiclyavailable Hansard transcripts of the debates conducted in the UK Parliament .
Our proposed approach , which uses community - based graph information to augment hand -crafted features based on topic modeling and emotion detection on debate transcripts currently surpasses the benchmark results on the same dataset .
Such sentiment classification systems could prove to be of great use in today 's politically turbulent times , for public knowledge of politicians stands on various relevant issues proves vital for good governance and citizenship .
The experiments also demonstrate that continuous feature representations learned from graphs can improve performance on sentiment classification tasks significantly .
Introduction
One of the key aspects of a functional , free society is being presented with comprehensive options in electing government representatives .
The decision is aided by the positions politicians take on relevant issues like water , housing , etc .
Hence , it becomes important to relay political standings to the general public in a comprehensible manner .
The Hansard transcripts of speeches delivered in the UK Parliament are one such source of information .
However , owing to the voluminous quantity , * Indicates equal contribution .
esoteric language and opaque procedural jargon of Parliament , it is tougher for the non-expert citizen to assess the standings of their elected representative .
Therefore , conducting stance classification studies on such data is a challenging task with potential benefits .
However , the documents tend to be highly tedious and difficult to comprehend , and thus become a barrier to information about political issues and leanings .
Sentiment analysis of data from various relevant sources ( social media , newspapers , transcripts , etc. ) has often given several insights about public opinion , issues of contention , general trends and so on ( Carvalho et al. , 2011 ; Loukis et al. , 2014 ) .
Such techniques have even been used for purposes like predicting election outcomes and the reception of newly - launched products .
Since these insights have wide - ranging consequences , it becomes imperative to develop rigorous standards and state - of - the - art techniques for them .
One aspect that helps with analyzing such patterns and sentiments is studying about the interconnections and networks underlying such data .
Homophily , or the tendency of people to associate with like -minded individuals , is the fundamental aspect of depicting relationships between users of a social network ( for instance ) .
Constructing graphs to map such complex relationships and attributes in data could help one arrive at ready insights and conclusions .
This comes particularly useful when studying parliamentary debates and sessions ; connecting speakers according to factors like party or position affiliations pro-vides information on how a speaker is likely to respond to an issue being presented .
Attempts to analyze social media data based on such approaches have been made ( Deitrick and Hu , 2013 ) .

The analysis of political content and parliamentary debates have opened an exciting line of research in recent years and has shown promising results in tasks of stance classification ( Hasan and Ng , 2013 ) and opinion mining ( Karami et al. , 2018 ) .
A large part of the work initially concentrated on legislative speeches , but the focus has shifted to social media content analysis in recent times .
This shift in focus has been particularly rapid with the proliferation of social media data and research ( ?

There have been some approaches to model interactions among members of a network to help in the task of sentiment analysis .
Moreover , there have been applications that extract information about each user by representing them as a node in the social graph and creating low dimensional representation usually induced by neural architectures ( Grover and Leskovec , 2016 ) .
Mishra et al. ( 2018 ) and Qian et al . ( 2018 ) use such social graph - based features to gain considerable improvement in the task of abuse detection in social media .
However there has been no work done to model the interaction between the members of the Parliament for the task of stance classification .
For studying transcripts of speeches delivered in the House of Commons in the UK Parliament , Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro ( 2018 b ) curated a dataset consisting of parliamentary motions and debates as provided in the Hansard transcripts , along with other information like party affiliations and polarities of the motions being discussed .
This was followed by carrying out studies on the dataset and developing a sentiment analysis model which also demonstrated the results of motionindependent ( one-step ) and motion - dependent classification of polarities Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro ( 2018a ) .
This dataset is used for further analysis in our experiments .
Dataset
In the UK , transcripts of parliamentary debates are publicly available along with information related to division votes as well as manually annotated sentiment labels .
To investigate the effectiveness of our pipeline , experiments were conducted using the HanDeSeT dataset as created by ( Abercrombie and Batista - Navarro , 2018 b ) .
The dataset consists of 607 politicians and their speeches over various motions , with a total of 1251 samples .
The speeches are divided into five utterances , and other features such as Debate ID , Debate title , Motion subject with polarities : manual annotation and ruling - opposing - based , Motion and Speaker party affiliations , Speech Polarities : manual and votebased , Rebellion percentage .
Sentiment polarity is present in both speeches and motions .
Hence labels are provided for motion polarities as well .
Two label types are provided for motions : a manually - annotated one predicting positive or negative polarity , and a government / opposition one decided as follows : if the speaker who proposes the motion belongs to the ruling government , the polarity is positive ; if the speaker belongs to the opposition then the polarity is negative .
Two label types are provided for speeches as well : one manually - annotated , and the other a speaker - vote label extracted from the division related to the corresponding debate .
Methodology
The models described in Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro ( 2018a ) extracted n-gram features ( uni-grams , bi-grams , tri-grams , and their combinations ) from the utterances for sentiment classification .
The stance - based relationships between the members are modeled , and their effectiveness is analyzed .
This study aims to develop on the limitations of using only text - based features and by doing so present a sound , coherent model for sentiment classification for parliamentary speeches .
The methodology consists of the following subsections : preprocessing , to describe the initial data preprocessing methods undertaken ; feature extraction , which discusses feature sets used for our model , and model description and training , to elaborate on our model and training procedures .
Preprocessing
The dataset was preprocessed for further analysis .
This was required so unnecessary words ; characters etc. could be removed and not add further noise to the dataset .
The text was lower -cased , and all punctuation marks and other special characters were removed .
Following this , stopword removal was done using NLTK .
Finally , a few custom stopwords specific to the parliamentary procedure were removed .
These were taken from Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro ( 2018 b ) .
Finally , the utterances were concatenated and prepared for feature extraction and model training .
Feature Extraction
Textual Features Various textual features were extracted for classification and normalized using the L2 norm .
These are listed below .
? TF -IDF : Term Frequency - inverse Document Frequency ( TF - IDF ) features were extracted from n-grams ( upto 3 ) in the text .
N-gram features are immensely useful for factoring in contextual information surrounding the components of a text ( whether characters or words ) and are widely used for text analysis , language processing , etc. ? LDA - based topic modeling :
Topic modeling is used to derive information related to the underlying " topics " contained in a text .
In order to extract such topic-based features from the utterances , the Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) ( Blei et al. , 2003 ) model was used .
The probability distribution over the most commonly occurring 30 topics was used as features for each speech .
? NRC Emotion : The NRC Emotion Lexicon ( Mohammad and Turney , 2013 ) is a publicly available lexicon that contains commonly occurring words along with their affect category ( anger , fear , anticipation , trust , surprise , sadness , joy , or disgust ) and two polarities ( negative or positive ) .
The score along these 10 features was computed for the utterances .
Graph - based features
For our analysis , two graphs were constructed from the dataset .
The graph consists of nodes that represent the members who participate in the proceedings of the Parliament .
The edges among the members are conditioned upon their accord or discord on debates regarding policies .
Two members of the same or varying political parties either agree on a policy or differ on it .
Therefore , the two graphs are constructed .
? simGraph :
In order to model the similarity on stances among members , G sim ( v , e ) is a weighted undirected graph induced on the dataset with vertices v corresponding to the members m of political parties where an edge e between two vertices v and u is defined as weight ( e ) =| f ( v ) ? f ( u ) | where f ( v ) is the set of stances taken by the member that is represented by node v. ?
oppGraph : Similarly , to model the differences among the members , G opp ( v , e ) is induced on the dataset such that an edge e between two vertices v and u is defined as weight ( e ) =| ( f ( v ) \ f ( u ) ) ? ( f ( u ) \ f ( v ) ) | where f ( v ) is the set of stances taken by the member that is represented by node v. node2vec :
To obtain community based embeddings , feature representations were generated using node2vec ( Grover and Leskovec , 2016 ) . node2vec is similar to word2vec ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 b ) and uses the same loss function to assign similar representations to nodes that are in the context of each other .
To obtain the context of a node , node2vec samples a neighborhood for each of the nodes by constructing a fixed number of random walks of constant length .
The traversal strategy for these random walks is determined by the hyper-parameters Return Parameter p and In-out Parameter q which have the ability to moderate the sampling between a depth-first strategy and a breadth - first strategy .
The return parameter p controls the likelihood of immediately revisiting a node in the walk , while the in- out parameter q allows the search to differentiate between inward and outward nodes .
Formally , given a graph G = ( V , E ) , we learn a function f : V ?
IR d that maps nodes to feature representations where d is the dimension of the representation .
In order to do so , for every node u ?
V , we define a neighbourhood N S ( u ) ?
V is generated using the sampling strategy S. The skip- gram model ( Mikolov et al. , 2013a ) is then employed to maximize the following objective function : max f logP r( N s ( u ) | f ( u ) ) .
( 1 ) Combining Graph Embeddings :
To combine embeddings generated for each member in the two graphs , a dense neural network was used .
The embeddings were projected onto a linear layer and fine-tuned upon the classification task .
The penultimate layer of the model was used as the graph embedding corresponding to each user .
The network consisted of two input layers for the two embedding sets , followed by single dense layers with hidden layer size 16 and activation ReLU .
These two layers were then combined , and the resultant combination passed through two dense layers ( layer size 16 , activation ReLU ) , before being passed through a final dense softmax layer .
The network was optimized using Adam , and trained over 20 epochs with batch size 64 .
Other features
Of all the feature sets explored in Abercrombie and Batista-Navarro ( 2018a ) , the feature set all the meta-features had the best results consistently across all the three models .
Hence , we used these in addition to our textual and community - based graph features .
The meta-features consisted of speaker party affiliation , debate IDs and motion party affiliation .
Baseline models
The original experiments consisted of 3 models for classification : a one-step model and two two -step models .
We consider the two-step models as our baselines , which are described below .
?
manAnnot : a two -step model in which motion polarity classification is first performed based on manually - annotated positive or negative sentiments , corresponding to model 2a in the original experiments ; ? govAnnot : a two -step model in which motion polarity classification is first performed based on government or opposition labeling , corresponding to model 2 b in the original experiments .
In the case of the two two -step models , the dataset is divided into two parts based on the predicted polarities .
These two divided datasets are then used for training and classification separately .
Two classifiers were used in both the steps : Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) with the linear kernel and Multi-Layer Perceptron ( MLP ) with 1 hidden layer containing 100 neurons .
Proposed model
In the original experiment , the best results were obtained from the two-step models with the MLP classifier .
A similar two -step approach is followed here as well , with MLP as the chosen classifier .
The network consists of 1 hidden layer with 100 neurons .
Experiments Experiments on two models are presented :
1 . manAnnot : here , the dataset is divided into two parts based on predicted motion polarity from manually annotated labels .
2 . govAnnot :
Here , the dataset is separated into two parts based on the speaker 's affiliation : if the speaker presenting the motion belongs to the ruling government , then the motion polarity is positive , or otherwise negative .
The hyperparameters ( for each of the feature sets and the classifier ) were tuned using grid search .
L-BFGS ( Liu and Nocedal , 1989 ) was used for optimization in the neural network .
Model training and evaluation was carried out using stratified 10 fold cross-validation .
Stratification was performed to account for the slight imbalance in the dataset .
Two types of labels are presented in the dataset : vote-based and manually - annotated .
We use the manually - annotated labels for our experiments .
For the graph- based features , a grid search was performed which yielded the following parameters for generating embeddings : ? simGraph : p = 10 , q = 1 , walk length = 15 , number of walks = 15 , window size = 10 .
The feature vector obtained from these parameters yielded an accuracy of 79.51 % .
?
oppGraph : p = 0.1 , q = 10 , walk length = 5 , number of walks = 10 , window size = 10 .
The feature vector obtained from these parameters yielded an accuracy of 69.53 % .
Results and Discussion Table 2 and Table 3 present the results on the two models respectively .
The values of accuracy , pre-cision , recall , and F1 - score are presented on feature sets with and without graph - based features .
In the case of both models , the usage of graphbased features outperforms the results obtained without using them .
The difference is large in the case of the feature set comprising of LDA , NRC , and meta-features in the model with manuallyannotated labels : the F1 scores obtained with and without graph features differ by 7.8 % .
It can be observed that by using graph - based features
The baselines for both have been surpassed by using graph - based features along with the other textual and meta-features .
Our best results for manAnnot are obtained by using the combination of LDA , NRC , and graph - based features along with meta-features .
The best results for gov - Annot are obtained by using the combination of TF - IDF and meta-features along with graph - based features .
Conclusion
We presented a method for sentiment analysis of parliamentary debate transcripts , which could go a long way in helping determine the position an elected representative might assume on issues of great importance to the general public .
The experiments were carried out on the Hansard parliamentary debates dataset ( Abercrombie and Batista - Navarro , 2018 b ) .
We performed experiments on a variety of textual analysis methods ( e.g. topic modeling , emotion classification , n-grams ) , and combined them with community - based graph features obtained by representational learning on the dataset using node2vec .
Our results surpass the state - of - the - art results using both govAnnot and manAnnot .
Also , the F1 and accuracy values of the models using graph - based features are higher than those without graph - based features , the difference being considerable in some cases .
This gives sufficient demonstration for the ability of representational learning to enhance performances on tasks like sentiment analysis .
