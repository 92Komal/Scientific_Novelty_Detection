A Sentiment-Controllable Topic-to-Essay Generator with Topic Knowledge Graph
abstract
Generating a vivid , novel , and diverse essay with only several given topic words is a challenging task of natural language generation .
In previous work , there are two problems left unsolved : neglect of sentiment beneath the text and insufficient utilization of topicrelated knowledge .
Therefore , we propose a novel Sentiment - Controllable topic-to-essay generator with a Topic Knowledge Graph enhanced decoder , named SCTKG , which is based on the conditional variational autoencoder ( CVAE ) framework .
We firstly inject the sentiment information into the generator for controlling sentiment for each sentence , which leads to various generated essays .
Then we design a Topic Knowledge Graph enhanced decoder .
Unlike existing models that use knowledge entities separately , our model treats knowledge graph as a whole and encodes more structured , connected semantic information in the graph to generate a more relevant essay .
Experimental results show that our SCTKG can generate sentiment controllable essays and outperform the state - of - theart approach in terms of topic relevance , fluency , and diversity on both automatic and human evaluation .
Introduction Topic-to-essay generation ( TEG ) task aims at generating human- like paragraph - level texts with only several given topics .
It has plenty of practical applications , e.g. , automatic advertisement generation , intelligent education , or assisting in keyword - based news writing ( Lepp? nen et al. , 2017 ) .
Because of its great potential in practical use and scientific research , TEG has attracted a lot of interest .
( Feng et al. , 2018 ; Yang et al. , 2019 ) .
However ,
In TEG , two problems are left to be solved : the neglect of sentiment beneath the text and the insufficient utilization of topic-related knowledge .
Love is a kind of emotion .
Love experience is important to every one ....
A well - performed essay generator should be able to generate multiple vivid and diverse essays when given the topic words .
However , previous work tends to generate dull and generic texts .
One of the reason is that they neglect the sentiment factor of the text .
By modeling and controlling the sentiment of generated sentences , we can generate much more diverse and fascinating essays .
As shown in Figure 1 , given the topic words " Love " , " Experience " and " Emotion " , the " without sentiment " model generates monotonous article .
In contrast , the sentiment - attach model generates positive statements such as " fall in love with my boyfriend " when given the " positive " label , and generates negative phrases such as " addicted to smoking " , " broke up " when given the " negative " label .
In addition , sentiment control is especially essential in topicto-essay generation task , which aims to generate multiple sentences .
As the number of sentences increases , the search space for generation model is exponentially enlarged by controlling the sentiment polarity for each of the sentence .
Therefore , the ability to control sentiment is essential to improve discourse - level diversity for the TEG task .
It 's been half a year since I fell in love
As for the other problem , imagine that when we human beings are asked to write articles with some topics , we heavily rely on our commonsense knowledge related to the topics .
Therefore , the proper usage of knowledge plays a vital role in the topic-to-essay generation .
Previous state - of- the - art method ( Yang et al. , 2019 ) extracts topic-related concepts from a commonsense knowledge base to enrich the input information .
However , they ignore the graph structure of the knowledge base , which merely refer to the concepts in the knowledge graph and fail to consider their correlation .
This limitation leads to concepts being isolated from each other .
For instance , given two knowledge triples ( law , antonym , disorder ) and ( law , part of , theory ) , about the topic word law , Yang et al . ( 2019 ) simply uses the neighboring concepts disorder and theory as a supplement to the input information .
However , their method fails to learn that disorder has opposite meaning with law while theory is a hypernym to law , which can be learned from their edges ( correlations ) in the knowledge graph .
Intuitively , lacking the correlation information between concepts in the knowledge graph hinders a model from generating appropriate and informative essays .
To address these issues , we propose a novel Sentiment - Controllable topic-to-essay generator with a Topic Knowledge Graph enhanced decoder , named SCTKG , which is based on the conditional variational auto-encoder ( CVAE ) framework .
To control the sentiment of the text , we inject the sentiment information in the encoder and decoder of our model to control the sentiment from both sentence level and word level .
The sentiment labels are provided by a sentiment classifier during training .
To fully utilize the knowledge , the model retrieves a topic knowledge graph from a largescale commonsense knowledge base ConceptNet ( Speer and Havasi , 2012 ) .
Different from Yang et al. ( 2019 ) , we preserve the graph structure of the knowledge base and propose a novel Topic Graph Attention ( TGA ) mechanism .
TGA attentively reads the knowledge graphs and makes the full use of the structured , connected semantic information from the graphs for a better generation .
In the meantime , to make the generated essays more closely surround the semantics of all input topics , we adopt adversarial training based on a multi-label discriminator .
The discriminator provides the reward to the generator based on the coverage of the output on the given topics .
Our contributions can be summarized as follow : 1 . We propose a sentiment - controllable topic-toessay generator based on CVAE , which can generate high-quality essays as well as control the sentiment .
To the best of our knowledge , we are the first to control the sentiment in TEG and demonstrate the potential of our model to generate diverse essays by controlling the sentiment .
2 . We equip our decoder with a topic knowledge graph and propose a novel Topic Graph Attention ( TGA ) mechanism .
TGA makes the full use of the structured , connected semantic information from the topic knowledge graph to generate more appropriate and informative essays .
3 . We conduct extensive experiments , showing that our model accurately controls the sentiment and outperforms the state - of - the - art methods both in automatic and human evaluations .
Task Formulation Traditional TEG task takes as input a topic sequence X = ( x 1 , ? ? ? , x m ) with m words , and aims to generate an essay with M sentences ( L 1 , ? ? ? , L M ) corresponding with topic sequence X . In this paper , we provide a sentiment sequence S = ( s 1 , ? ? ? , s M ) , each of which corresponds to a target sentence in essay .
Each sentiment can be positive , negative , or neutral .
Essays are generated in a sentence - by-sentence manner .
The first sentence L 1 is generated only conditioned on the topic sequence X , then the model takes all the previous generated sentences as well as the topic sequence to generate the next sentence until the entire essay is completed .
In this paper , we denote the previous sentences L 1:i?1 as context .
Model Description
In this section , we describe an overview of our proposed model .
Our SCTKG generator based on a CVAE architecture consists of an encoder and a topic knowledge graph enhanced decoder .
The encoder encodes topic sequence , sentiment , and context and regards them as conditional variables c.
Then a latent variable z is computed from c through a recognition network ( during training ) or prior network ( during inference ) .
The decoder attaches with a topic knowledge graph and sentiment label to generate the texts .
At each decoding step , the TGA is used to enrich input topic information through effectively utilizing the topic knowledge graph .
We adopt a two -stage training approach : ( 1 ) Train the SCTKG generator with the conventional CVAE loss ; ( 2 ) After the first step is done , we introduce a topic label discriminator to evaluate the performance of SCTKG generator .
We adopt adversarial training to alternately train the generator and the discriminator to further enhance the performance of the SCTKG generator .
SCTKG Generator
Encoder
As shown in Figure 2 , the utterance encoder is a bidirectional GRU ( Chung et al. , 2014 ) to encode an input sequence into a fixed - size vector by concatenating the last hidden states of the forward and backward GRU .
We use the utterance encoder to encode the topic sequence X into h x = [ ? ? h x , ? ? h x ] , h x ?
R d . d is the dimension of the vector .
The next sequence L i is also encoded by utterance encoder into h i = [ ? ? h i , ? ? h i ] , h i ?
R d .
For context encoder , we use a hierarchical encoding strategy .
Firstly , each sentence in context L 1:i?1 is encoded by utterance encoder to get a fixed - size vector .
By doing so , the context L 1:i?1 is encoded into h context = [ h 1 , h 2 . . . , h i?1 ] .
Then a single layer forward GRU is used to encode the sentence representations h context into a final state vector h c ?
R d .
Then the concatenation of h c , h x , e( s ) is functionalized as the conditional vector c = [ e ( s ) ; h c ; h x ] . e( s ) is the embedding of sentiment label s .
We assume that z follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a diagonal covariance matrix .
Thus the recognition network q ? ( z|h i , c ) and the prior network p ? ( z|c ) follow N ? , ? 2 I and N ? , ?
2 I , respectively .
I is identity matrix , and then we have ? , ? 2 = MLP recognition ( h i , c ) , ? , ? 2 = MLP prior ( c ) .
( 1 ) Additionally , we use a reparametrization trick ( Kingma and Welling , 2013 ) to sample z from the recognition network during training and from prior network during testing .
Decoder
A general Seq2seq model may tend to emit generic and meaningless sentences .
To create more meaningful essays , we propose a topic knowledge graph enhanced decoder .
The decoder is based on a 1 - layer GRU network with initial state d 0 = W d [ z , c , e ( s ) ] + b d .
W d and b d are trainable decoder parameters and e( s ) is the sentiment embedding as mentioned above .
As shown in Figure 2 , we equip the decoder with a topic knowledge graph to incorporate commonsense knowledge from Con-ceptNet 1 . ConceptNet is a semantic network which consists of triples R = ( head ; rel ; tail ) .
The head concept head has the relation rel with tail concept tail .
We use word vectors to represent head and tail concepts and learn trainable vector r for relation rel , which is randomly initialized .
Each word in the topic sequence is used as a query to retrieve a subgraph from ConceptNet and the topic knowledge graph is constituted by these subgraphs .
Then we use the Topic Graph Attention ( TGA ) mechanism to read from the topic knowledge graph at each generation step .
Topic Graph Attention .
As previously stated , a proper usage of the external knowledge plays a vital role in our task .
TGA takes as input the retrieved topic knowledge graph and a query vector q to produce a graph vector g t .
We set q = [ d t?1 ; c ; z ] , where d t?1 represents the decoder hidden state for t ?
1 step .
At each decoding step , we calculate the correlation score between each of the triples in the graph and q .
Then we use the correlation score to compute the weighted sum of all the neighboring concepts 2 to the topic words to form the final graph vector g t .
Neighboring concepts are entities that directly link to topic words .
We formalize the computational process as follows : g t = N n=1 ? n o n , ( 2 ) ? n = exp ( ? n ) N j=1 exp ( ? j ) , ( 3 ) ? n = ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( W 1 q ) tanh ( W 2 r n + W 3 o n ) when o n ?
S 1 , ( W 1 q ) tanh ( W 2 r n + W 4 o n ) when o n ?
S 2 ( 4 ) where o n is the embedding of n th neighboring concept and r n is the embedding of the relation for n th triple in the topic knowledge graph .
W 1 , W 2 , W 3 , W 4 are weight matrices for query , relations , head entities and tail entities , respectively .
S 1 contains the neighboring concepts which being the head concepts in their triples , while S 2 contains the neighboring concepts which being the tail concepts .
The matching score ?
n represents the correlation between the query q and neighbouring concept o n .
Essentially , a graph vector g t is the weighted sum of the neighbouring concepts of the topic words .
Note that we use different weight matrices to distinguish the neighboring concepts in different positions ( in head or in tail ) .
This distinction is necessary .
Topic Label Discriminator
Another concern is that the generated texts should be closely related to the topic words .
To this end , at the second training stage , a topic label discriminator is introduced to perform adversarial training with the SCTKG generator .
In a max-min game , the SCTKG generator generates essays to make discriminator consider them semantically match with given topics .
Discriminator tries to distinguish the generated essays from real essays .
In detail , suppose there are a total of m topics , the discriminator produces a sigmoid probability distribution over ( m + 1 ) classes .
The score at ( m + 1 ) th index represents the probability that the sample is the generated text .
The score at the j th ( i ? { 1 , ? ? ? , m} ) index represents the probability that it belongs to the real text with the j th topic .
Here the discriminator is a CNN ( Kim , 2014 ) text classifier .
Training
We introduce our two stage training method in this section .
Stage 1 : Similar to a conventional CVAE model ,
The loss of our SCTKG generator ?logp ( Y | c ) can be expressed as : ? L ( ? ; ? ; c ; Y ) cvae = L KL + L decoder = KL ( q ? ( z|Y , c ) p ? ( z| c ) ) ? E q ? ( z| Y , c ) ( log p D ( Y |z , c ) ) . ( 5 ) Here , ? and ? are the parameters of the prior network and recognition network , respectively .
Intuitively , L decoder maximizes the sentence generation probability after sampling from the recognition net-work , while L KL minimizes the distance between the prior and recognition network .
Besides , we use the annealing trick and BOW - loss ( Zhao et al. , 2017 ) to alleviate the vanishing latent variable problem in VAE training .
Stage 2 : After trained the SCTKG generator with equation ( 5 ) , inspired by SeqGan ( Yu et al. , 2017 ) , we adopt adversarial training between the generator and the topic label discriminator described in section 3.2 .
We refer reader to Yu et al . ( 2017 ) and Yang et al . ( 2019 ) for more details .
Experiments
Datasets
We conduct experiments on the ZHIHU corpus ( Feng et al. , 2018 ) .
It consists of Chinese essays 3 whose length is between 50 and 100 .
We select topic words based on frequency and remove rare topic words .
The total number of topic labels are set to 100 .
Sizes of the training set and the test set are 27,000 essays and 2500 essays .
For tuning hyperparameters , we set aside 10 % of training samples as the validation set .
The sentence sentiment labels is required for our model training .
To this end , we sample 5000 sentences from the dataset and annotated the data manually with three categories , i.e. , positive , negative , neutral .
This dataset was divided into a training set , validation set , and test set .
We use an open-source Chinese sentiment classifier Senta 4 to finetune on our manually - label training set .
This classifier achieves an accuracy of 0.83 on the test set .
During training , the target sentiment labels s is computed by the sentiment classifier automatically .
During inference , users can input any sentiment labels to control the sentiment for sentence generation .
Implementation Details
We use the 200 - dim pre-trained word embeddings provided by and dimension of sentiment embeddings is 32 .
The vocabulary size is 50,000 and the batch size is 64 .
We use a manually tuning method to choose the hyperparameter values and the criterion used to select is BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002a ) .
We use GRU with hidden size 512 for both encoder and decoder and the size of latent variables is 300 .
We implement the model with Tensorflow 5 .
The number of parameters is 68 M and parameters of our model were randomly initialized over a uniform distribution [ - 0.08,0.08 ] .
We pre-train our model for 80 epochs with the MLE method and adversarial training for 30 epochs .
The average runtime for our model is 30 hours on a Tesla P40 GPU machine , which adversarial training takes most of the runtime .
The optimizer is Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) with 10 ?3 learning rate for pre-training and 10 ?5 for adversarial training .
Besides , we apply dropout on the output layer to avoid over-fitting ( Srivastava et al. , 2014 ) ( dropout rate = 0.2 ) and clip the gradients to the maximum norm of 10 .
The decoding strategy in this paper uses greedy search and average length of generated essays is 79.3 .
Evaluation
To comprehensively evaluate the generated essays , we rely on a combination of both automatic evaluation and human evaluation .
Automatic Evaluation .
Following previous work ( Yang et al. , 2019 ) , we consider the following metrics 6 : BLEU : The BLEU score ( Papineni et al. , 2002 b ) is widely used in machine translation , dialogue , and other text generation tasks by measuring word overlapping between ground truth and generated sentences .
Dist -1 , Dist -2 ( Li et al. , 2015 ) :
We calculate the proportion of distinct 1 - grams and 2 - grams in the generated essays to evaluate the diversity of the outputs .
Consistency ( Yang et al. , 2019 ) :
An ideal essay should closely surround the semantics of all input topics .
Therefore , we pre-train a multi-label classifier to evaluate the topic-consistency of the output .
A higher " Consistency " score means the generated essays are more closely related to the given topics .
Novelty ( Yang et al. , 2019 ) :
We calculated the novelty by the difference between output and essays with similar topics in the training corpus .
A higher " Novelty " score means the output essays are more different from essays in the training corpus .
Precision , Recall and Senti-F1 : These metrics are used to measure sentiment control accuracy .
If the sentiment label of the generated sentence is consistent with the ground truth , the generated result is right , and wrong otherwise .
The sentiment label is predicted by our sentiment classifier mentioned above ( see 4.1 for details about this classifier ) .
Human Evaluation .
We also perform human evaluation to more accurately evaluate the quality of generated essays .
Each item contains the input topics and outputs of different models .
Then , 200 items are distributed to 3 annotators , who have no knowledge in advance about the generated essays come from which model .
Each annotator scores 200 items and we average the score from three annotators .
They are required to score the generated essay from 1 to 5 in terms of three criteria : Novelty , Fluency , and Topic-Consistency .
For novelty , we use the TF - IDF features of topic words to retrieve 10 most similar training samples to provide references for the annotators .
To demonstrate the paragraph- level diversity of our model , we propose a Essay - Diversity criteria .
Specifically , each model generates three essays with the same input topics , and annotators are required to score the diversity by considering the three essays together .
Baselines TAV ( Feng et al. , 2018 ) represents topic semantics as the average of all topic embeddings and then uses a LSTM to generate each word .
Their work also includes the following two baselines .
TAT ( Feng et al. , 2018 ) extends LSTM with an attention mechanism to model the semantic relatedness of each topic word with the generator 's output .
MTA ( Feng et al. , 2018 ) maintains a topic coverage vector to guarantee that all topic information is expressed during generation through an LSTM decoder .
CTEG ( Yang et al. , 2019 ) adopts commonsense knowledge and adversarial training to improve gen-eration .
It achieves state - of- the - art performance on the topic-to-essay generation task .
Results and Analysis
In this section , we introduce our experimental results and analysis from two part : the " text quality " and " sentiment control " .
Then we show case study of our model .
Results on Text Quality
The automatic and human evaluation results are shown in Table 1 .
We present three different versions of our model for a comprehensive comparison . ( 1 ) " SCTKG ( w/o- Senti ) " means we do not attach any sentiment label to the model . ( 2 ) " SCTKG ( Ran - Senti ) " means we randomly set the sentiment label for each generated sentence . ( 3 ) " SCTKG ( Gold - Senti ) " means we set the golden sentiment label for the generated sentence .
By investigating the results in Table 1 , we have the following observations :
First , all versions of our SCTKG models outperform the baselines in all evaluation metrics ( except the BLEU score of SCTKG ( Ran - Senti ) ) .
This demonstrates that our SCTKG model can generate better essays than baseline models , whether uses the true sentiment , random sentiment or without any sentiment .
Second , we can learn the superiority of the basic architecture of our model through the comparison between SCTKG ( w / o- Senti ) and the baselines .
In human evaluation , SCTKG ( w / o- Senti ) outperform CTEG in topic-consistency , essay - diversity , and fluency by + 0.15 ( 3.74 vs 3.89 ) , +0.82 ( 3.08 vs 3.90 ) , +0.12 ( 3.59 vs 3.71 ) respectively .
Similar improvements can be also drawn from the automatic evaluation .
The improvement in essay- diversity is the most significant .
This improvement comes from our CVAE architecture because our sentence representation comes from the sampling from a continuous latent variable .
This sampling operation introduces more randomness compared with baselines .
Third , as previously stated , each model generates three essays and considers them as a whole when comparing the " E-div " .
When given the random and diverse sentiment label sequences , our SCTKG ( Ran - Senti ) achieves the highest " E-div " score ( 4.29 ) .
Consider that CVAE architecture has already improved the diversity compared with baselines .
By randomizing the sentiment of each sentence , SCTKG ( Ran - Senti ) further boosts this improvement ( from + 0.82 to + 1.21 compared with CTEG ) .
This result demonstrates the potential of our model to generate discourse- level diverse essays by using diverse sentiment sequences , proving our claim in the introduction part .
Fourth , when using the golden sentiment label , SCTKG ( Gold - Senti ) achieves the best performance in BLEU ( 11.02 ) .
However , we find the SCTKG ( Gold- Senti ) do not significantly outperforms other SCTKG models in other metrics .
The results show the true sentiment label of the target sentence benefits SCTKG ( Gold - Senti ) to better fit in the test set , but there is no obvious help for other important metrics such as diversity and topicconsistency .
Fifth , we find it interesting that when removing the sentiment label , the SCTKG ( w / o- Senti ) achieves the best topic-consistency score .
We conceive that sentiment label may interfere with the topic information in the latent variable to some extent .
But the effect of this interference is trivial .
Comparing SCTKG ( w/o- Senti ) and SCTKG ( Gold- Senti ) , the topic-consistency only drops 0.08 ( 3.89 vs 3.81 ) for human evaluation and 1.27 ( 43.84 vs 42.57 ) for automatic evaluation , which is completely acceptable for a sentiment controllable model .
Ablation study on text quality .
To understand how each component of our model contributes to the task , we train two ablated versions of our model : without adversarial training ( " w / o AT " ) and without TGA ( " w / o TGA " ) .
Noted that in the " w/ o TGA " experiment , we implement a memory network the same as Yang et al . ( 2019 ) bels .
Table 2 presents the BLEU scores and human evaluation results of the ablation study .
By comparing full model and " w/ o TGA " , we find that without TGA , the model performance drops in all metrics .
In particularly , topicconsistency drops 0.27 , which shows that by directly learning the correlation between the topic words and its neighboring concepts , concepts that are more closely related to the topic words are given higher attention during generation .
Novelty drops 0.2 , the reason is that TGA is an expansion of the external knowledge graph information .
Therefore the output essays are more novel and informative .
Fluency drops 0.37 because TGA benefits our model to choose a more suitable concept in the topic knowledge graph according to the current context .
And the BLEU drops for 0.68 shows TGA helps our model to better fit the dataset by modeling the relations between topic words and neighboring concepts .
By comparing full model and " w/ o AT " , we find that adversarial training can improve the BLEU , topic-consistency , and fluency .
The reason is that the discriminative signal enhancing the topic consistency and authenticity of the generated texts .
Results on Sentiment Control
In this section , we investigate whether the model accurately control the sentiment and how each component affects our sentiment control performance .
We train three ablated versions of our model : without sentiment label in encoder , without sentiment label in decoder , and without TGA .
We randomly sample 50 essays in our test set with 250 sentences .
Instead of using golden sentiment labels , the sentiment labels are randomly given in this section .
Predicting the golden sentiment is relatively simple because sometimes emotional labels can be directly derived from the coherence between contexts .
We adopt a
Methods Precison Recall Senti-F1 more difficult experimental setting that aims to generate sentences following arbitrary given sentiment labels .
The results are shown in Table 3 .
We can learn that removing the sentiment label either from encoder or decoder leads to an obvious control performance decrease ( - 11 % / - 6 % on Senti - F1 ) and the sentiment label in the encoder is the most important , since removing it leads to the most obvious decline ( - 11 % Senti - F1 ) .
Although TGA does not directly impose sentiment information , it still helps to improve the control ability ( 4 % in Senti - F1 ) , which shows that learning correlations among concepts in topic knowledge graph strengthens the emotional control ability of the model .
For instance , when given a positive label , the concepts related to the relation " desire of " are more likely to attach more attention , because the concepts with the relation " desire of " may represent more positive meaning .
Case Study
Table 4 presents an example of our output essay with a random sentiment sequence .
Positive sentences are shown in red and negative sentences are shown in blue .
We can learn that the output es-say is not only closely related to the topic " Law " and " Education " , but also corresponding with the randomly given sentiment label .
Meanwhile , our model makes full use of commonsense knowledge with the help of TGA .
For example , " high school student " and " right " are the neighboring concepts related to the topic words " Education " and " Law " .
Related Work Topic-to - Text Generation .
Automatically generating an article is a challenging task in natural language processing .
Feng et al. ( 2018 ) are the first to propose the TEG task and they utilize coverage vector to integrate topic information .
Yang et al. ( 2019 ) use extra commonsense knowledge to enrich the input information and adopt adversarial training to enhancing topic-consistency .
However , both of them fail to consider the sentiment factor in the essay generation and fully utilize the external knowledge base .
These limitations hinder them from generating high-quality texts .
Besides , Chinese poetry generation is similar to our task , which can also be regarded as a topicto-sequence learning task .
adopt CVAE and adversarial training to generate diverse poetry .
use CVAE with hybrid decoders to generate Chinese poems .
And Yi et al . ( 2018 ) use reinforcement learning to directly improve the diversity criteria .
However , their models are not directly applicable to TEG task .
Because they do not take knowledge into account , their models cannot generate long and meaningful unstructured essays .
Controllable Text Generation .
Some work has explored style control mechanisms for text generation tasks .
For example , Zhou and Wang ( 2017 ) use naturally annotated emoji Twitter data for emotional response generation .
Wang and Wan ( 2018 ) propose adversarial training to control the sentiment of the texts .
Chen et al . ( 2019 ) propose a semi-supervised CVAE to generate poetry and deduce a different lower bound to capture generalized sentiment -related semantics .
Different from their work , we inject sentiment label in both encoder and decoder of CVAE and prove that by modeling a topic knowledge graph can further enhance the sentiment control ability .
Conclusions
In this paper , we make a further step in a challenging topic-to-essay generation task by proposing a novel sentiment - controllable topic-to-essay generator with a topic knowledge graph enhanced decoder , named SCTKG .
To get better representation from external knowledge , we present TGA , a novel topic knowledge graph representation mechanism .
Experiments show that our model can not only generate sentiment - controllable essays but also outperform competitive baselines in text quality .
Figure 1 : 1 Figure1 : Examples of comparison between the generated essays with sentiment control and without sentiment .
We show the first two sentences for each generated essay and denote positive sentences in red and negative sentences in blue .
Sentences without sentiment label are showed in black .

The text generated by SCTKG generator feeds to topic label discriminator .
The above m blue circle represents the probability that it belongs to the real text with the m input topics , and the green circle represents the given text is a generated text .
For instance , given two knowledge triples ( Big Ben , part of , London ) and ( London , part of , England ) .
Even though the concepts Big Ben and England are both neighboring concepts to London with the same relation part of , they have the different meaning with regard to London .
We need to model this difference by W 3 and W 4 . Then the final probability of generating a word is computed by P t = softmax ( W o [ d t ; e( s ) ; g t ] + b o ) , where d t is the decoder state at t step and W o ?

d model is the dimension of [ d t ; e( s ) ; g t ] and | V | is vocabulary size .
