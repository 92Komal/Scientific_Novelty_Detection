The results show that incorporation of the sentiment information from social media can help to improve the stock prediction .
Introduction
Stock price forecasting is very important in the planning of business activity .
However , building an accurate stock prediction model is still a challenging problem .
In addition to historical prices , the current stock market is affected by the mood of society .
The overall social mood with respect to a given company might be one of the important variables which affect the stock price of that company .
Nowadays , the emergence of online social networks makes large amounts of mood data available .
Therefore , incorporating information from social media with the historical prices can improve the predictive ability of the models .
The goal of our research is to develop a model to predict a stock price movement using information from social media ( Message Board ) .
In our proposed method , the model predicts the movement of the stock value at t using features derived from information at t ?
1 and t ?
2 , where t stands for a transaction date .
It will be trained by supervised machine learning .
Apart from the mood information , the stock prices are affected by many factors such as microeconomic and macroeconomic factors .
However , this research only focuses on how the mood information from social media can be used to predict the stock price movement .
That is , the mood of topics in social media is extracted by sentiment analysis .
Then , the topics and their sentiments are integrated into the model to predict the stocks .
To achieve this goal , discovering the topics and sentiments in a large amount of social media is important to get opinions of investors as well as events of companies .
However , sentiment analysis on social media is difficult .
The text is usually short , contains many misspellings , uncommon grammar constructions and so on .
In addition , the literature shows conflicting results in sentiment analysis for stock market prediction .
Some researchers report that the sentiments from social media have no predictive capabilities ( Antweiler and Frank , 2004 ; Tumarkin and Whitelaw , 2001 ) , while other researchers have reported either weak or strong predictive capabilities ( Bollen et al. , 2011 ) .
Therefore , how to use opinions in social media for stock price predictions is still an open problem .
Our contributions are summarized as follows : 1 . We propose a new feature " topic-sentiment " for the stock market prediction model .
2 . We propose a new topic model , Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( TSLDA ) , which can capture the topic and sentiment simultaneously .
3 . Large scale evaluation .
Most of the previous researches are limited on predicting for one stock ( Bollen et al. , 2011 ; Qian and Rasheed , 2007 ; Si et al. , 2013 ) , and the number of instances ( transaction dates ) in a test set is rather low such as 14 or 15 instances ( Bollen et al. , 2011 ; Vu et al. , 2012 ) .
With only a few instances in the test set , the conclusion might be insufficient .
This is the first research that shows good prediction results on evaluation of many stocks using a test set consisting of many transaction dates .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 introduces some previous approaches on sentiment analysis for stock prediction .
Section 3 explains our model for sentiment analysis by simultaneously inferring the topic and sentiment in the text .
Section 4 describes two kinds of datasets required for stock prediction .
Section 5 describes our prediction models and also proposes a novel feature based on the topics and sentiments .
Section 6 assesses the results of the experiments .
Finally , Section 7 concludes our research .
Related Work Stock market prediction is one of the most attracted topics in academic as well as real life business .
Many researches have tried to address the question whether the stock market can be predicted .
Some of the researches were based on the random walk theory and the Efficient Market Hypothesis ( EMH ) .
According to the EMH ( Fama et al. , 1969 ; Fama , 1991 ) , the current stock market fully reflects all available information .
Hence , price changes are merely due to new information or news .
Because news in nature happens randomly and is unknowable in the present , stock prices should follow a random walk pattern and the best bet for the next price is the current price .
Therefore , they are not predictable with more than about 50 % accuracy ( Walczak , 2001 ) .
On the other hand , various researches specify that the stock market prices do not follow a random walk , and can be predicted in some degree ( Bollen et al. , 2011 ; Qian and Rasheed , 2007 ; Vu et al. , 2012 ) .
Degrees of accuracy at 56 % hit rate in the predictions are often reported as satisfying results for stock predictions ( Schumaker and Chen , 2009 b ; Si et al. , 2013 ; Tsibouris and Zeidenberg , 1995 ) .
Besides the efficient market hypothesis and the random walk theories , there are two distinct trading philosophies for stock market prediction : fundamental analysis and technical analysis .
The fundamental analysis studies the company 's financial conditions , operations , macroeconomic indicators to predict the stock price .
On the other hand , the technical analysis depends on historical and time -series prices .
Price moves in trends , and history tends to repeat itself .
Some researches have tried to use only historical prices to predict the stock price ( Zuo and Kita , 2012a ; Zuo and Kita , 2012 b ) .
To discover the pattern in the data , they used Bayesian network ( Zuo and Kita , 2012a ; Zuo and Kita , 2012 b ) , time-series method such as Auto Regressive , Moving Average , Auto Regressive Moving Average model ( Zuo and Kita , 2012a ) and so on .
Extracting Opinions from Text Sentiment analysis has been found to play a significant role in many applications such as product and restaurant reviews ( Liu and Zhang , 2012 ; Pang and Lee , 2008 ) .
There are some researches trying to apply sentiment analysis on information sources to improve the stock prediction model .
There are two main such sources .
In the past , the main source was the news ( Schumaker and Chen , 2009a ; Schumaker and Chen , 2009 b ) , and in recent years , social media sources .
A simple approach is combining the sentiments in the textual content with the historical prices through the linear regression model .
Most of the previous work primarily used the bag-of-words as text representation that are incorporated into the prediction model .
Schumaker and Chen tried to use different textual representations such as bag-of-words , noun phrases and named entities for financial news ( Schumaker and Chen , 2009 b ) .
However , the textual representations are just the words or named entity tags , not exploiting the mood information so much .
A novel tree representation based on semantic frame parsers is proposed ( Xie et al. , 2013 ) .
By using stock prices from Yahoo Finance , they annotated all the news in a transaction date with going up or down categories .
However , the weakness of this assumption is that all the news in one day will have the same category .
In addition , this is a task of text classification , not stock prediction .
Naive Bayes was used to classify messages from message boards into three classes : buy , hold and sell ( Antweiler and Frank , 2004 ) .
They were integrated into the regression model .
However , they concluded that their model does not successfully predict stock returns .
A method to measure collective hope and fear on each day and analyze the correlation between these indices and the stock market indicators was proposed ( Zhang et al. , 2011 ) .
They used the mood words to tag each tweet as fear , worry , hope and so on .
They concluded that the ratio of the emotional tweets significantly negatively correlated with Down Jones , NASDAQ and S&P 500 , but positively with VIX .
However , they did not use their model to predict the stock price values .
Two mood tracking tools , OpinionFinder and Google Profile of Mood States , were used to analyze the text content of daily Twitter ( Bollen et al. , 2011 ) .
The former measures the positive and negative mood .
The latter measures the mood in terms of six dimensions ( Calm , Alert , Sure , Vital , Kind , and Happy ) .
They used the Self Organizing Fuzzy Neural Network model to predict DJIA values .
The results showed 86.7 % direction accuracy ( up or down ) and 1.79 % Mean Absolute Percentage Error .
Although they achieved the high accuracy , there were only 15 transaction dates ( from December 1 to 19 , 2008 ) in their test set .
With such a short period , it might not be sufficient to conclude the effectiveness of their method .
A keyword - based algorithm was proposed to identify the sentiment of tweets as positive , neutral and negative for stock prediction ( Vu et al. , 2012 ) .
Their model achieved around 75 % accuracy .
However , their test period was short , from 8 th to 26 th in September 2012 , containing only 14 transaction dates .
Continuous Dirichlet Process Mixture ( cDPM ) model was used to learn the daily topic set of Twitter messages to predict the stock market ( Si et al. , 2013 ) .
A sentiment time series was built based on these topics .
However , the time period of their whole dataset is rather short , only three months .
Most of the researches tried to extract only the opinions or sentiments .
However , one important missing thing is that opinions or sentiments are expressed on topics or aspects of companies .
Therefore , understanding on which topics of a given stock people are expressing their opinion is very important .
Although the models for inferring the topics and sentiments simultaneously have already proposed as discussed in Subsection 2.2 , to the best of our knowledge , such models have never applied for stock market prediction .
Aspect based Sentiment Analysis
Some researches tried to identify the sentiment expressed toward an aspect in a sentence rather than a whole sentence or document .
The simple ap- proach is to define a sentiment score of a given aspect by the weighted sum of opinion scores of all words in the sentence , where the weight is defined by the distance from the aspect ( Liu and Zhang , 2012 ; Pang and Lee , 2008 ) .
This method is further improved by identifying the aspect-opinion relations using tree kernel method ( Nguyen and Shirai , 2015 ) .
Other researches trying to extract both the topic and sentiment for some domains such as online product , restaurant and movie review dataset .
ASUM is a model for extracting both the aspect and sentiment for online product review dataset ( Jo and Oh , 2011 ) .
Joint sentiment / topic model ( JST ) is another model to detect the sentiment and topic simultaneously , which was applied for movie review dataset ( Lin and He , 2009 ) .
These models assume that each word is generated from a joint topic and sentiment distribution .
It means that these models do not distinguish the topic word and opinion word distributions .
Besides the general opinion words , topic models considering aspect-specific opinion words were also proposed .
MaxEnt -LDA hybrid model can jointly discover both aspects and aspectspecific opinion words on a restaurant review dataset ( Zhao et al. , 2010 ) , while FACTS , CFACTS , FACTS -R , and CFACTS -R model were proposed for sentiment analysis on a product review data ( Lakkaraju et al. , 2011 ) .
However , one of the weaknesses of these methods is that there is only one opinion word distribution corresponding to one topic ( aspect ) .
It makes difficult to know which sentiment ( e.g. positive or negative ) is expressed by the opinion words on that topic .
To overcome this drawback , we propose a new topic model called Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( TSLDA ) , which estimates different opinion word distributions for individual sentiment categories for each topic .
To the best of our knowledge , such a model has not been proposed .
TSLDA is suitable for not only sentiment analysis for stock prediction but also general sentiment analysis of the document , sentence and aspect .
TSLDA : Topic Sentiment Latent Dirichlet Allocation
The proposed model TSLDA infers the topics and their sentiments simultaneously .
It is an extended model of Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) ( Blei et al. , 2003 ) .
We assume that one sentence ex -
For example , the opinion word " low " in " low cost " and " low salary " have opposite polarity .
In our model , different topics , which are also represented by word distributions , will have different opinion word distributions .
Finally , to capture the sentiment meanings such as positive , negative or neutral of the opinion words for each topic , we distinguish opinion word distributions for different sentiment meanings .
Figure 1 shows the graphical model representation of TSLDA .
Observed and hidden variables are indicated by shaded and clear circles , respectively .
Table 1 shows the notations in Figure 1 .
The generation process in TSLDA is as follows : 1 . Choose a distribution of background words ? b ? Dirichlet ( ? )
2 . For each topic k : ?
Choose a distribution of topic words ? t k ? Dirichlet ( ? ) ?
For each sentiment s of topic k : - Choose a distribution of sentiment words ?
o k , s ? Dirichlet ( ? ) w d, m , n ? ? ? ? ? ? M ultinomial ( ?
b ) if c d, m , n = 0 M ultinomial ( ?
t z t d , m ) if c d, m , n = 1 M ultinomial ( ?
o z t d , m , z o d , m ) if c d , m , n = 2 ( 1 )
We will define some notations for explanation of our method .
W k,s d , m , v , c is the number of times the word v with the category c appears in the sentence m in the document d , where m discusses the topic k and the sentiment s.
Let Z k ,s d be the number of times the document d has the topic k and the sentiment s .
If any of these dimensions is not limited to a specific value , we used an asterisk * to denote it .
For example , W k, s * , * , v, c is the number of appearance of combination ( v , c , k , s ) in any sentences in any documents .
Similarly , Z k , * d is the number of times the document d has the topic k with any sentiments .
A bold -font variable denotes the list of the variables .
For instance , z t and w denote all of topic assignments and words in all documents , respectively . ?( d , m ) stands for exclusion of the value in the sentence m in the document d .
For example , z t ?( d , m ) denotes all of topic assignment variables z t but z t d , m . Z a , * ?( d , m ) d denotes the value of Z a , * d not counting times at the sentence m in the document d .
We used square brackets for specifying the value at the index of a vector or distribution .
For instance , ?[ v ] denotes the value of ? at index v. Collapsed Gibbs Sampling was implemented for inference in TSLDA .
It will sequentially sample hidden variables z t d , m and z o d , m from the distribution over these variables given the current values of all other hidden and observed variables .
In other words , in order to perform Collapsed Gibbs Sampling , conditional probability P ( z t d , m = a , z o d , m = b|z t ?( d , m ) , z o ?( d , m ) , w , c ) is calculated by marginalizing out random variables ?
b , ?
t , ?
o , ? t and ?
o .
Because of the limit of spaces , we only show the final formula of this conditional probability as in Equation ( 2 ) .
Let V d , m be a set of words in the sentence m in the document d .
V is a set of all of the words in all documents .
P ( z t d , m = a , z o d , m = b|z t ?( d , m ) , z o ?( d , m ) , w , c , ) ? ( Z a , * ?( d , m ) d + ?[ a ] ) ( Z * , b?( d , m ) d + ?[ b ] ) ?
V d, m v=1 W * , * d, m , v,1 j=1 ( W a , * ?( d , m ) * , * , v,1 + ?[ v ] + j ?
1 ) W * , * d, m , * ,1 j=1 ( V v=1 W a , * ?( d , m ) * , * , v,1 + ?[ v ] + j ? 1 ) ? V d, m v=1 W * , * d, m , v, 2 j=1 ( W a , b? ( d , m ) * , * , v,2 + ?[ v ] + j ?
1 ) W * , * d, m , * ,2 j=1 ( V v=1 W a , b? ( d , m ) * , * , v,2 + ?[ v ] + j ?
1 ) ( 2 ) Multinomial parameters : Finally , samples obtained from Collapsed Gibbs Sampling can be used to approximate the multinomial parameter sets .
The distributions of topics and sentiments in the document d are estimated as in Equation ( 3 ) .
? t d [ a ] = Z a , * d + ?[ a ]
K k=1 Z k , * d + ?[ k ] ; ? o d [ b ] = Z * , b d + ? [ b ]
S s=1 Z * , s d + ?[ s ] ( 3 )
The background word distribution , topic word distribution of the topic k and sentiment word distribution of the sentiment s for k are estimated in Equation ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , respectively .
? b [ r ] = W * , * * , * , r,0 + ? [ r ]
V v=1 W * , * * , * , v,0 + ?[ v ] ( 4 ) ? t k [ r ] = W k , * * , * , v,1 + ? [ r ]
V v=1 W k , * * , * , v,1 + ?[ v ] ( 5 ) ? o k, s [ r ] = W k, s * , * , v,2 + ?[ r ] V v=1 W k , s * , * , v,2 + ?[ v ] ( 6 )
Dataset
Two datasets are used for the development of our stock prediction model .
One is the historical price dataset , and the other is the message board dataset .
Historical Price Dataset Historical prices are extracted from Yahoo Finance for 5 stocks .
The list of the stock quotes and company names is shown in Table 2 .
For each transaction date , there are open , high , low , close and adjusted close prices .
The adjusted close prices are the close prices which are adjusted for dividends and splits .
They are often used for stock market prediction as in other researches ( Rechenthin et al. , 2013 ) .
Therefore , we chose it as the stock price value for each transaction date .
Message Board Dataset
To get the mood information of the stocks , we collected 5 message boards of the 5 stocks from Yahoo Finance Message Board for a period of one year ( from July 23 , 2012 to July 19 , 2013 ) .
On the message boards , users usually discuss company news , prediction about stock going up or down , facts , comments ( usually negative ) about specific company executives or company events .
The stock market is not opened at the weekend and holiday .
To assign the messages to the transaction dates , the messages which were posted from 4 pm of the previous transaction date to 4 pm of the current transaction date will belong to the current transaction .
We choose 4 pm because it is the time of closing transaction .
There are 249 transaction dates in the one year period in our dataset .
Stock Prediction Models with Sentiment Analysis
This paper focuses on prediction of not the stock price but movement of it .
That is , our goal is to develop a model that predicts if the stock price goes up or down .
Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) has long been recognized as being able to efficiently handle high dimensional data and has been shown to perform well on many tasks such as text classification ( Joachims , 1998 ; Nguyen and Shirai , 2013 ) .
Therefore , we chose SVM with the linear kernel as the prediction model .
Furthermore , features derived by sentiment analysis on the message board are incorporated in it .
To assess the effectiveness of sentiment analysis , four sets of features are designed .
The first one uses only the historical prices .
The other sets include topic and sentiment features obtained by different methods .
All the feature values are scaled into [ ? 1 , 1 ] value .
Table 3 summarizes our features used in the model to predict the price movement at the transaction date t.
The details of each feature will be explained in the next subsections .
Price Only
In this method , only historical prices are used to predict the stock movement .
The purpose of this method is to investigate whether there are patterns of the price movement in the history of the stock .
In addition , it is a baseline for evaluation of the
LDA - based Method
In this model , we consider each message as a mixture of hidden topics .
LDA is a generative probabilistic model of a corpus 1 .
The basic idea is that documents are represented as random mixtures over latent topics , where each topic is characterized by a distribution over words .
Hidden topics of LDA are incorporated into the prediction model as follows .
First , stop words are removed from the messages , and all the words are lemmatized by Stanford CoreNLP ( Manning et al. , 2014 ) .
Topics are inferred by Gibbs Sampling with 1000 iterations .
Next , the probability of each topic for each message is calculated .
For each transaction date t , the probability of each topic is defined as the average of the probabilities of the topic in all messages posted on that transaction date .
Features used for training SVM are price t?1 , price t?2 , lda i, t and lda i ,t?1 . lda i, t and lda i ,t? 1 are the probabilities of the topic i ( i ? { 1 , ? ? ? , K} ) for the transaction dates t and t ?
1 . The number of the topics K is empirically determined as explained in Subsection 6.1 .
JST - based Method
When people post the message on social media to express their opinion for a given stock , they tend to talk their opinions for a given topic or aspect such as profit and dividend .
They would think that the future price of the stock goes up or down by seeing pairs of topic-sentiment written by others .
Following the above intuition , we propose a new feature topic-sentiment for the stock predic -
One is a latent topic based model called JST ( Lin and He , 2009 ) .
The other is TSLDA discussed in Section 3 .
This subsection introduces the method using the former .
We consider each message as a mixture of hidden topics and sentiments .
JST model is used to extract topics and sentiments simultaneously .
4 . In LDA model , there is only one document specific topic distribution .
In contrast , each document in JST is associated with multiple sentiment labels .
Each sentiment label is associated with a document specific topic distribution .
A word in the document is drawn from a distribution over words defined by the topic and sentiment label .
After removal of stop words and lemmatization , JST model is trained by Gibbs Sampling with 1000 iterations .
We chose 3 as the number of sentiments which might represent negative , neu-tral and positive .
The number of the topics K is empirically determined as explained in Subsection 6.1 .
Next , the joint probability of each pair of topic and sentiment is calculated for each message .
For each transaction date t , the joint probability of each topic-sentiment pair is defined as the average of the joint probabilities in the messages on that transaction date .
Then we integrate these probabilities into the prediction model .
Features used for training SVM are price t?1 , price t?2 , jst i , j, t and jst i , j, t?1 . jst i , j, t and jst i , j, t? 1 are the joint probabilities of the sentiment i ( i ? { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) and topic j ( j ? { 1 , ? ? ? , K} ) for the transaction dates t and t ? 1 .
TSLDA - based Method
We use our TSLDA model to capture the topics and sentiments simultaneously .
First , a rule- based algorithm is applied to identify the category of each word in the documents .
Consecutive nouns are considered as topic words .
If a word is not a noun and in a list of opinion words in SentiWord - Net ( Baccianella et al. , 2010 ) , it is considered as an opinion word .
The rest of words are classified as background words .
After lemmatization , TSLDA model is trained by Collapsed Gibbs Sampling with 1000 iterations .
We chose 3 as the number of sentiments which might represent for negative , neutral and positive .
K ( number of topics ) is determined as explained in Subsection 6.1 .
The topic and its sentiment in each sentence are gotten from the topic assignment and sentiment assignment in TSLDA .
If there is a sentence expressing the sentiment j on the topic i , we represent the tuple ( i , j ) = 1 , and 0 otherwise .
The proportion of ( i , j ) over all sentences are calculated for each message .
For each transaction date , a weight of the tuple ( i , j ) is defined as the average of the proportions over all messages .
Then we integrated the weights of the topics and their sentiments into the prediction model .
Features used for training SVM are price t?1 , price t?2 , tslda i , j, t and tslda i , j, t?1 . tslda i , j, t and tslda i , j, t ? 1 are the weights of the topic i ( i ? { 1 , ? ? ? , K} ) with the sentiment j ( j ? { 1 , 2 , 3 } ) for the transaction dates t and t ?
1 . To optimize the number of topics K for each stock , we run the models with four values of K : 10 , 20 , 50 and 100 .
The best K is chosen for each stock on the development set , and the systems with the chosen K is evaluated on the test data .
The performance of the prediction is measured by accuracy .
For the hyperparameters of LDA , JST and TSLDA , we simply selected symmetric Dirichlet prior vectors , that is all possible distributions are likely equal .
We used the default values of these hyperparameters for LDA and JST .
Concretely speaking , ? = 0.5 , ? = 0.01 in LDA and ? = 50 # topics , ? = 0.01 , ? = 0.3 were used in JST .
For TSLDA , we set ? = 0.1 , ? = 0.1 , ? = 0.01 and ? = 0.01 .
Results
The result of each stock is shown in Table 5 .
In addition , the average of 5 stocks for each model is revealed in the last row of this table for easy comparison .
Our model TSLDA - based method outperformed the other methods on the average of the stocks .
Table 6 shows the number of true positive ( TP ) , true negative ( TN ) , false positive ( FP ) and false negative ( FN ) of models for the stocks .
For easy comparison , the summation for these five stocks are calculated in the last row .
To assess the effectiveness of integrating mood information , we compare our TSLDA - based method with Price Only method .
The results showed that the model using mood information outperformed the model without mood by 3.57 % , 3.58 % , 14.29 % and 12.5 % accuracy for XOM , EBAY , IBM and KO stock , respectively .
On the other hand , the performance on DELL stock was not improved .
It means that the use of the mood does not always make the performance better .
The mood from social media could lead to a wrong prediction because of wrong prediction of message writers , fault information and so on .
However , TSLDA was better than Price Only method on average of these stocks .
In addition , TSLDA can reduce the number of FN , especially for IBM , although FP was not changed in the sum of 5 stocks .
Thus , we can conclude that integrating the mood information from social media can help to predict stock price movement more precisely .
Next , let us compare the models for inferring latent topics only ( LDA ) and topics and sentiments ( JST and TSLDA ) in the stock movement prediction .
The accuracy of JST - based method was better than LDA for two stocks ( XOM and IBM ) , worse for three stocks and comparable in the average of five stocks .
While , TSLDA - based method outperformed LDA and JST by 2 to 17 % in the accuracy for five stocks .
TSLDA was also better than LDA and JST on average as shown in Table 5 .
The improvement of the accuracy was derived by increase of TP and decrease of FN .
These results indicate that ( 1 ) our idea to use both latent topics and sentiments as the features is effective , ( 2 ) TSLDA is more appropriate model than JST in stock movement prediction .
Table 7 shows examples of highly associated words of some topics for stock KO ( Coca - Cola Company ) in TSLDA .
For example , ' split ' , ' stock ' and ' share ' are words highly associated with the hidden topic 2 , and ' drink ' , ' coke ' and ' water ' are highly associated with the topic 3 .
The first five hidden topics in Table 7 may represent the management , stock market trading , product , customer care service , competitors of the company , while the last one indicates macroeconomic factors .
Table 8 shows examples of highly associated words of three sentiments of the hidden topic 1 and 2 .
For the hidden topic 1 , ' growth ' , ' strong ' , ' solid ' etc. are the words highly associated with the hidden sentiment 3 ( which may corresponds to positive class ) , while ' old ' , ' tired ' , ' unreal ' etc. with the hidden sentiment 1 ( may be negative ) .
In general , however , it is rather difficult to interpret the meaning of the hidden sentiment because the sentiments have many dimensions such as happy , anger , sad , vital and so on .
We also found that the words with high probabilities in the background distribution were the stop words , punctuations , function words , messy characters written in social media , e.g. '. ' , ' the ' , ' and ' , ' you ' , ' $ ' , ' for ' and ' ?'.
Table 9 shows top words in some joint sentiment topic distributions of JST model for stock KO .
For example , ' yahoo ' , ' ko ' and ' finance ' are highly associated with the distribution defined by hidden sentiment 1 and hidden topic 1 .
However , it is rather difficult to guess which sentiment or topic in this joint distribution actually means .
Conclusion
This paper presents the method to infer the topics and their sentiments on the documents and use them for prediction of the stock movement .
The results of the experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed TSLDA - based method .
Although 56 % accuracy of our method is not so high , it can be satisfying results as regarded in the previous papers .
Another advantage of the paper is the evaluation by the large scale experiment ( five stocks , three month transaction dates in the test set ) .
The drawback of TSLDA is that we have to specify the number of topics and sentiment beforehand .
To overcome it , TSLDA should be extended as a non-parametric topic model estimating the number of topics inherent in the data .
This will be done in our future work .
