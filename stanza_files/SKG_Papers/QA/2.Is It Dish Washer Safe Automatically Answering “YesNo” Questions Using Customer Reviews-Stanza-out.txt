Automatically Answering " Yes / No " Questions using Customer Reviews
abstract
It has become commonplace for people to share their opinions about all kinds of products by posting reviews online .
It has also become commonplace for potential customers to do research about the quality and limitations of these products by posting questions online .
We test the extent to which reviews are useful in question - answering by combining two Amazon datasets , and focusing our attention on yes / no questions .
A manual analysis of 400 cases reveals that the reviews directly contain the answer to the question just over a third of the time .
Preliminary reading comprehension experiments with this dataset prove inconclusive , with accuracy in the range 50- 66 % .
Introduction
Consumers often carry out online research about a product before purchasing .
This can take the form of reading consumer reviews and / or asking specific questions on online fora .
In this paper we ask whether a question - answering ( QA ) system can utilize the information in consumer reviews when answering yes / no questions about a product .
We compile a dataset of questions about Amazon products together with consumer reviews of the same products , and manually analyse a sample of 100 questions from four domains .
We find that the reviews contain the answer in only 45 % of cases .
In 36 % of cases , the answer is directly expressed in at least one of the reviews , and 9 % of the time , it is indirectly expressed .
This suggests that reviews can sometimes be useful and so we go on to experiment with QA systems that use the reviews in addition to the question .
We focus on yes / no questions .
Being able to answer these is not only an indicator of whether reviews will be useful for other question types but is also a signal of how much comprehension is actually taking place .
In our preliminary experiments with three domains from this new dataset , we compare systems which attempt to answer a yes / no question based on the question alone to those that also use related reviews .
We experiment with two methods for selecting relevant sentences from the reviews , and with various representations for encoding the questions and reviews including bag-ofwords , word2vec ( Le and Mikolov , 2014 ) , ELMO ( Peters et al. , 2018 ) , and BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ) .
On the development set , our systems tend to outperform the chance baseline but not by a large margin - our development set results range from 50 to 66 % .
Over the three domains , we also find that the question -only systems tend to perform as well as and sometimes outperform those which also use the reviews , suggesting that separating the answers from the noise in these reviews is not straightforward .
Related Work
A number of studies have explored the use of customer reviews in retrieval and question answering .
Using Amazon data , Yu et al. ( 2018 ) develop a framework which returns a ranked list of sentences from reviews or existing question - answer pairs for a given question .
Xu et al . ( 2019 ) create a new dataset comprising Amazon laptop reviews and questions and Yelp restaurant reviews and questions , where reviews are used to answer questions in multiple - turn dialogue form .
Bogdanova et al. ( 2017 ) and Bogdanova and Foster ( 2016 ) ) do not use review data but also focus on QA over usergenerated content , attempting to find similar questions or rank answers in user fora .
We use the same Amazon data as Yu et al . ( 2018 ) but consider a wider set of domains ( they consider only two ) , and attempt to directly answer yes / no questions .
To the best of our knowledge , the novelty in our work lies in trying to directly answer customer questions using user- generated reviews .
Unlike popular Reading Comprehension datasets such as MovieQA ( Tapaswi et al. , 2016 ) and SQuAD ( Rajpurkar et al. , 2018 ( Rajpurkar et al. , , 2016 , which are created by crowdsourcing , we work with authentic user- generated data .
This means that the data is collected from sources where users spontaneously created content for their own purposes .
Since there is no guarantee that reviews contain text related to the question , there is no span data that can be reliably used to provide the answer .
This , together with the considerable volume of review text , contributes to the difficulty of the task .
Data
We work with two Amazon datasets : the first , He and McAuley ( 2016 ) , 1 is a collection of product reviews from 24 domains .
The second , Wan and McAuley ( 2016 ) ; McAuley and Yang ( 2016 ) , contains questions and answers about products from 21 domains .
These two datasets have 17 domains in common and can be matched using the Amazon Standard Identification Number ( ASIN ) .
In order to obtain data with reviews , questions and answers , we first select all those products which contain reviews and questions , focusing on yes / no questions .
We observe that the majority of questions can be answered " Yes " ( 65 - 75 % depending on the domain ) , so we balance the data by selecting an equal amount of yes / no questions .
This results in 80391 questions about 40806 products - see Table 1 for more details .
All data is fully user-generated except the answer tags which are provided by McAuley and Yang ( 2016 ) .
An example of the combined data is shown below ( we keep the original spelling ) .
Reviews ( R ) : ... I was a little surprised at how much time it took to assemble .
There were alot of the smaller parts that I would have assumed pre-assembled that were n't ...
The authentic user- generated nature of this dataset makes it significantly different from other 1 More details here : http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/ data/ amazon / - last verified ( l.v. ) 02/20119

To save space we provide only part of user review reading comprehension datasets .
Table 2 shows a comparison with MovieQA and SQuAD2.0 .
The length of questions is almost the same ( 10 - 11.5 words ) in all three datasets , although the number of instances ( movie plots for MovieQA , topic for SQuAD and product for Amazon ) is significantly bigger .
Moreover , the average length of context in the Amazon data is unquestionably larger than in the MovieQA and SQuAD : 188 vs 35 and 5 sentences , and 3265 vs 728 and 117 words .
To better understand the nature of questions we carried out some additional analysis looking into question formulation .
21 % of questions are formulated with more than one sentence ( 16 - 31 % depending on the domain ) , more than 25 % of questions ( 20686 ) start with the word Does , and more than 15 % ( >12000 ) with Can , Is or Will .
Do reviews contain the answers ?
According to Kaushik and Lipton ( 2018 ) reading comprehension datasets are not studied enough in terms of difficulty .
We conduct a manual analysis to better understand the relationship between questions and reviews , to assess the feasibility of using user reviews to answer user questions and to estimate an upper bound on system performance .
100 questions from four domains are analysed .
We define seven classes of questions : Easy : Questions are clearly answered in the reviews , e.g. ( 1 ) R : ...
I used two of these , one for each side of the bed .
Q : can this product be used if 2 bed rails are needed for one bed ?
( AT : Yes ) Error : Questions where the answer tag contradicts the user-provided answer , e.g. ( Real-world : Questions where the review does not contain the answer but where an educated guess can be made using common sense or realworld knowledge , e.g. ( 4 ) Q : Can I use the cloth to clean the keys on my clarinet ?
( AT : Yes ) ( 5 ) Q : Has anyone traveled with this stroller on an airplane ?
( AT : No ) Opinion : Questions which can be answered differently based on different reviews ( 6 ) or when the answer and review contain contradictory information ( 7 ) .
Often such questions ask for an opinion , so the answer depends on the user providing it , e.g. ( 6 ) R : ... all in all these pans are worthless ... so many folks have had a horrid experience !!!
... At $ 15.00 , it 's a good pan for my purposes ... This pan is awesome for the price 3 Q : is this item any good ?
( AT : No ) ( 7 ) R : ... but it seems to get a little hot and makes a plastic noise under the sheet ...

The sentences are taken from different reviews .
Q : does it make noise when baby moves around ?
A : No not with a sheet on it .
( AT : No ) Unrelated : Questions which are asked not about the product but about service and delivery , e.g. ( 8 ) Q : Is there a warranty when you buy it from amazon ?
No answer : Questions which cannot be answered without additional information , i.e. reviews do not contain the required information .
The indirect and real-world classes can be considered to be difficult questions .
However , in general , we believe that the easy , indirect and realworld question classes can be answered without resorting to guessing .
Detailed information is provided in Table 3 . Around 53.5 % of questions can be answered ( 36.5 % are easy and 17 % are difficult ) .
Although it is difficult to conclude too much from this sample of 400 , we can roughly estimate that the best performance we could expect from an automatic QA system would be around 77 % .
This means the Table 3 : Selection of 100 questions from 4 domains for manual analysis .
The last column contains the percentage of the analysed questions from each domain ( eg. 100 is 4.6 % of the Baby question data , 3.6 % of Beauty , etc. ) . system answers all answerable questions correctly ( 53.5 % ) and guesses half of those questions which cannot be answered ( 23.25 % ) .
5 Preliminary Experiments
Approach
In order to establish some baselines on this dataset and task , we carry out preliminary binary classification experiments with a sample of the domains .
There are three aspects to the systems we evaluate : Text Representations
To represent questions and reviews we experiment with simple Bag of words ( BOW ) , word2vec ( Le and Mikolov , 2014 ) , Deep contextualized word representations ( ELMO ) ( Peters et al. , 2018 ) 4 and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers ( BERT ) ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ) .
5 Review Filtering
The reviews in our dataset are long compared to the answer passages used in other reading comprehension tasks - see Tables 1 and 2 . Pascanu et al. ( 2012 ) report that long sequences are hard to process from both time and resource perspectives with sequence - to-sequence models .
Therefore , rather than using the full text of the reviews , we use string similarity to select only those sentences that are likely to be relevant to the question .
We base our selection method on our previous work which achieved state - of- theart performance on the MovieQA reading comprehension task Tapaswi et al. , 2016 ) .
Review sentences are compared to the question using cosine similarity of tf- idf representations , bag of words overlap , character ngrams , and window slide .
Two sets of sentences are extracted .
The first one is based on sentence union , in other words , all sentences which have been marked as relevant by any of the metrics are selected .
The second one is based on sentence intersection , i.e. only sentences which have been marked as relevant by more than one similarity metric are selected .
Binary Classifier
Following our previous work we use logistic regression with the bag-of- word , ELMO and word2vec representations .
In the BERT experiments we add a softmax classification layer on top of the final hidden state of the transformer .
Experimental Setup
We compare systems which use the review and question text to systems which just use the question text .
We select three of the four domains used for manual analysis .
We exclude Clothing Shoes & Jewellery due to the small number of questions .
Table 4 represents the number of questions in the training , development and test set and the ratio of " Yes " and " No " questions in each of them .

The evaluation metric is accuracy .
For the bow and word2vec experiments , we normalize the text and remove stop words .
We use a pre-trained Google News word2vec model .
Every text is encoded as a sum of its word vectors and normalized .
For the ELMO representation we average three layers of ELMO output and represent a sentence as concatenation of its words vectors .
In the question-only BERT experiment , we perform single-sentence classification ( Devlin et al. , 2018 , Fig. 3 b ) .
In the experiments where the reviews are used , we perform sentence 7 pair classification where the question is the first sentence and the review text the second ( Devlin et al. , 2018 , Fig. 3a ) .
We use the pretrained models B base and B large .
Both of them are uncased .
Results
The development set results are shown in Table 5 .
Apparently , questions themselves provide some information and help find the correct answer : two out of three domains show the best performance using the question only .
Only the Home and Kitchen domain shows better performance with the question + review systems .
When selecting sentences from the reviews , there is no clear winner between the intersection and union methods .
It varies according to method and domain .
BERT , the base and large models , perform better then logistic regression on the development set so we apply the best question-only and ques-tion + review models to the test set ( Table 6 ) .
Performance drops below chance for two domains .
It remains to be seen why we are seeing this unstable performance .
Conclusions
We introduce a fully user- generated reading comprehension dataset by composing two existing datasets into a new one designed to addresses yes / no questions about products using reviews .
All data in this work is substantial and comes from real users .
We provide a preliminary analysis of data and show that reviews can , to some extent , be used to answer yes / no questions .
We build several baseline systems .
Although performance does not reach our estimated upper bound of 77 % , our results show that they are doing more than mere majority classification .
The relatively good performance of the question-only systems leads us to believe that the systems are applying closed - world assumptions by associating terms in the training set questions with terms in the test set questions .
Each of the components of our systems can be replaced or improved .
Our immediate next step is to investigate more closely the part of the system which selects relevant sentences from the reviews .
