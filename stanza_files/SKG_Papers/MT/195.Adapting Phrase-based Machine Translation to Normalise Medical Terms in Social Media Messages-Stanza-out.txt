Adapting Phrase - based Machine Translation to Normalise Medical Terms in Social Media Messages
abstract
Previous studies have shown that health reports in social media , such as Dai-lyStrength and Twitter , have potential for monitoring health conditions ( e.g. adverse drug reactions , infectious diseases ) in particular communities .
However , in order for a machine to understand and make inferences on these health conditions , the ability to recognise when laymen 's terms refer to a particular medical concept ( i.e. text normalisation ) is required .
To achieve this , we propose to adapt an existing phrase - based machine translation ( MT ) technique and a vector representation of words to map between a social media phrase and a medical concept .
We evaluate our proposed approach using a collection of phrases from tweets related to adverse drug reactions .
Our experimental results show that the combination of a phrase - based MT technique and the similarity between word vector representations outperforms the baselines that apply only either of them by up to 55 % .
Introduction Social media , such as DailyStrength 1 and Twitter 2 , is a fast growing and potentially rich source of voice of the patient data about experience in terms of benefits and side-effects of drugs and treatments ( O' Connor et al. , 2014 ) .
However , natural language understanding from social media messages is a difficult task because of the lexical and grammatical variability of the language ( Baldwin et al. , 2013 ; O'Connor et al. , 2014 ) .
Indeed , language understanding by machines requires the ability to recognise when a phrase refers to a particular concept .
Given a variable length phrase , an effective system should return a concept with the most similar meaning .
Table 1 shows examples of mappings between Twitter phrases and medical concepts .
For example , a Twitter phrase ' No way I 'm gettin any sleep 2 nite ' might be mapped to the medical concept ' Insomnia ' ( SNOMED :193462001 ) , when using the SNOMED - CT ontology ( Spackman et al. , 1997 ) .
The success of the mapping between social media phrases and formal medical concepts would enable an automatic integration between patient experiences and biomedical databases ( Limsopatham and Collier , 2015 ) .
We refer to this mapping from social media phrases to medical concepts as medical term normalisation , which aims to determine the unique identifier of a medical concept that is mentioned in different forms in a free-text ( Morgan et al. , 2008 ) .
Existing works , e.g. ( Elkin et al. , 2012 ; Gobbel et al. , 2014 ; Wang et al. , 2009 ) , mostly focused on identifying medical concepts in medical documents .
For example , Gobbel et al . ( 2014 ) proposed a na?ve Bayesian - based technique to map phrases from clinical notes to medical concepts in the SNOMED - CT ontology .
Wang et al. ( 2009 ) identified medical concepts regarding adverse drug events in electronic medical records .
On the other hand , O ' Connor et al . ( 2014 ) investigated the normalisation of medical terms in Twitter messages .
In particular , they proposed to use the Lucene retrieval engine 3 to retrieve medical concepts that could be potentially mapped to a given
Twitter phrase , when mapping between Twitter phrases and medical concepts .
In contrast , we argue that the medical text normalisation task can be achieved by using wellestablished phrase - based MT techniques , where we translate a text written in a social media language ( e.g . ' No way I 'm gettin any sleep 2 nite ' ) to a text written in a formal medical language ( e.g .
The main contributions of this paper are threefold : 1 . We investigate the adaptation of phrase - based MT to map a Twitter phrase to a SNOMED - CT concept .
2 . We propose to combine our adaptation of phrase - based MT and the similarity between word vector representations to map Twitter phrases to formal medical concepts .
3 . We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach using phrases from our collection of tweets related to the topic of adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) .
Related Work Phrase - based MT models , e.g. ( Koehn et al. , 2003 ; Och and Ney , 2004 ) , have been shown to be effective in translation between languages , as they learn local term dependencies , such as collocations , reorderings , insertions and deletions .
Koehn et al. ( 2003 ) showed that a phrase - based MT technique markedly outperformed traditional wordbased MT techniques on several benchmarks .
In this work , we adapt the phrase - based MT technique of Koehn et al . ( 2003 ) for the medical text normalisation task .
In particular , we use the phrase - based MT technique to translate phrases from Twitter language to formal medical language , before mapping the translated phrases to medical concepts based on the ranked similarity of their word vector representations .
Traditional approaches for creating word vector representations treated words as atomic units ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 b ; Turian et al. , 2010 ) .
For instance , the one-hot representation used a vector with a length of the size of the vocabulary , where one dimension is on , to represent a particular word ( Turian et al. , 2010 ) .
Recently , techniques for learning high-quality word vector representations ( i.e. distributed word representations ) that could capture the semantic similarity between words , such as continuous bags of words ( CBOW ) ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 b ) and global vectors ( GloVe ) ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) , have been proposed .
Indeed , these distributed word representations have been effectively applied in different systems that achieve state- ofthe - art performances for several NLP tasks , such as MT ( Mikolov et al. , 2013a ) and named entity recognition ( Passos et al. , 2014 ) .
In this work , beside using word vector representations to measure the similarity between translated Twitter phrases and the description of medical concepts , we use the similarity between word vector representations of the original Twitter phrase and the description of a medical concept to augment the adapted phrase - based MT technique .
Medical Term Normalisation
We discuss our adaptation of phrase - based MT for medical text normalisation in Section 3.1 .
Section 3.2 introduces our proposed approach for combining similarity score of word vector representations with the adapted phrase - based MT technique .
Adapting Phrase- based MT
We aim to learn a translation between a Twitter phrase ( i.e. a phrase from a Twitter message ) and a formal medical phrase ( i.e. the description of a medical concept ) .
For a given
Twitter phrase phr t , we find a suitable medical phrase phr m using a translation score , based on a phrase - based model , as follows : score translation ( phrm|phrt ) = p( phrm| phrt ) ( 1 ) where p( phr m | phr t ) can be calculated using any phrase - based MT technique , e.g. ( Koehn et al. , 2003 ; Och and Ney , 2004 ) .
We then rank translated phrases phr m based on this translation score .
The top-k translated phrases are used for identifying the corresponding medical concept .
However , the translated phrase phr m may not be exactly matched with the description of any target medical concepts .
We propose two techniques to deal with this problem .
For the first technique , we rank the target concepts based on the cosine similarity between the vector representation of phr m and the vector representation of the description of each concept desc c : simcos( phrm , descc ) = V phrm ?
V descc || V phrm || ? || V descc || ( 2 ) where V phrm and V descc are the vector representations of phr m and desc c , respectively .
Any technique for creating word vector representations ( e.g. one-hot , CBOW and GloVe ) can be used .
Note that if a phrase ( e.g. phr m ) contains several terms , we create a vector representation by summing the value of the same dimension of the vector representation of each word ( i.e. element- wise addition ) .
On the other hand , the second technique also incorporates the ranked position r of the translated phrase phr m when translated from the original phrase phr t using Equation ( 1 ) .
Indeed , the second technique calculates the similarity score as follows : simrcos ( phrm , descc ) = 1 r ?
V phrm ?
V descc || V phrm || ? || V descc || ( 3 )
Combining Similarity Score with Phrase- based MT As discussed in Section 2 , word vector representations ( e.g. created by CBOW or GloVe ) can capture semantic similarity between words by itself .
Hence , we propose to map a Twitter phrase phr t to a medical concept c , which is represented with a description desc c , by linearly combining the cosine similarity , between vector representations of the Twitter phrase phr t and the description desc c , with the similarity score computed using one of the adapted phrased - based MT techniques ( introduced in Section 3.1 ) , as follows : sim combine ( phr t , desc c ) = V phrt ?
V descc || V phrt || ? || V descc || ( 4 ) + M T a ( phr t , desc c ) where M T a ( phr t , desc c ) is calculated using one of the adapted phrase - based MT techniques described in Section 3.1 .
4 Experimental Setup
Test Collection 4
To evaluate our approach , we use a collection of 25 million tweets related to adverse drug reactions ( ADRs ) , from cognitive enhancers ( Hanson et al. , 2013 ) and anti-depressants ( Schneeweiss et al. , 2010 ) .
These tweets were collected using the Twitter Streaming API 5 by filtering on the name of a particular set of drugs that can have adverse reactions to the patients .
Note that terms regarding adverse drug reaction ( e.g. insomnia ) were not used for capturing tweets .
From this collection , we use 201 ADR phrases and their corresponding SNOMED - CT concepts annotated by a PhD - level computational linguist .
These phrases were anonymised by replacing numbers , user IDs , URIs , locations , email addresses , dates and drug names with appropriate tokens e.g. NUMBER .
Evaluation Approach
We conduct experiments using 10 - fold cross validation , where the Twitter phrases are randomly divided into 10 separated folds .
We address this task as a ranking task , where we aim to rank the medical concept with the highest similarity score , e.g. calculated using Equation ( 2 ) , at the top rank .
Hence , we evaluate our approach using Mean Reciprocal Rank ( MRR ) measure ( Craswell , 2009 ) , which is an information retrieval measure based on the user model where the user wants to see only one relevant concept .
In particular , MRR is based on the the reciprocal of the rank at which the first relevant concept is viewed in the ranking ( e.g. MRR = 0.5 if the first mapped concept is wrong but the second is correct ) .
We limit our evaluation at top 5 of the ranking ( i.e. MRR - 5 ) .
In addition , we compare the significant difference between the performance achieved by our proposed approach and the baselines using the paired t-test ( p < 0.05 ) .
Word Vector Representation
We use three different techniques , including onehot , CBOW and GloVe , to create word vector representations used in our approach ( see Section 3 ) .
In particular , the vocabulary for creating the one-hot representation includes all terms in the Twitter phrases and the descriptions of the target SNOMED - CT concepts .
Meanwhile , we create word vector representations based on CBOW and GloVe by using the word2vec 6 and GloVe 7 implementations .
We learn the vector representations from the collections of tweets and medical articles , respectively , using window size of 10 words .
The tweet collection ( denoted Twitter ) contains 419,702,147
English tweets , which are related to 11 drug names and 6 cities , while the medical article collection ( denoted BMC ) includes all medical articles from the BioMed Central 8 . For both CBOW and GloVe , we create vector representations with vector sizes 50 and 200 , respectively .
Learning Phrase - based Model
We use the phrase - based MT technique of Koehn et al . ( 2003 ) , as implemented in the Moses toolkit ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) 9 with default settings , to learn to translate from the Twitter language to the medical language .
In particular , when training the translator , we show the learner pairs of the Twitter phrases and descriptions of the corresponding SNOMED - CT concepts .
Experimental Results
We evaluate 6 different instantiations of the proposed approach discussed in Section 3 , including : 1 . bestMT : set k = 1 , when finding the translated phrase phr m for a Twitter phrase phr t ( Equation ( 1 ) ) , before ranking target medical concepts for the translated phrase phr m using Equation ( 2 ) .
2. top5 MT : similar to bestMT , but set k = 5 .
3 . top5 MTr : similar to top5 MT , but also consider the rank position of the translate phrases when ranking the target medical concepts by using Equation ( 3 ) .
4 . bestMT +vSim : incorporate with the ranking generated from bestMT , the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the Twitter phrase phr t and the description desc c of target medical concepts by using Equation ( 4 ) .
5 . top5MT + vSim : similar to bestMT +vSim , but use the ranking from top5 MT .
6 . top5 MTr+ vSim : similar to bestMT +vSim , but use the ranking from top5 MTr .
Another baseline is vSim , where we consider only the cosine similarity between the vector representations of the Twitter phrase phr t and the description desc c of target medical concepts .
Table 2 compares the performance of these 6 instantiations and the vSim baseline in terms of MRR -5 .
We firstly observe that for the vSim baseline , excepting for word vector representation with vector size 50 learned using GloVe from the Twitter collection , word vector representations learned using either CBOW or GloVe are more effective than the one-hot representation .
However , the difference between the MRR - 5 performance is not statistically significant ( p > 0.05 , paired t-test ) .
In addition , word vector representations learned either using CBOW or GloVe with vector size 200 is more effective than those with vector size 50 .
Next , we find that our adaptation of phrasebased MT ( i.e. bestMT , top5 MT and top5 MTr ) significantly ( p < 0.05 ) outperforms the vSim baseline .
For example , with the one-hot representation , top5 MT ( MRR - 5 0.2491 ) and top5 MTr ( MRR - 5 0.2458 ) perform significantly ( p < 0.05 ) better than vSim ( MRR - 5 0.1675 ) by up to 49 % .
Meanwhile , when using word vector representations with the vector size 200 learned using GloVe from the BMC collection , top5 MT ( MRR - 5 0.2638 ) significantly ( p < 0.05 ) outperforms vSim with either the GloVe vector representation ( MRR - 5 0.1869 ) or the one-hot representation ( MRR - 5 0.1675 ) .
We observe the similar trends in performance
In addition , we observe the effectiveness of our combined approach ( i.e. bestMT + vSim , top5MT + vSim and top5 MTr + vSim ) , as it further improves the performance of the adapted phrasebased MT ( i.e. bestMT , top5 MT and top5 MTr , respectively ) , when using the one-hot representation .
For example , top5 MTr + vSim achieves the MRR - 5 of 0.2594 , while the MRR - 5 of top5 MTr is 0.2458 .
However , the performance difference is not statistically significant .
Meanwhile , when using the CBOW and GloVe vectors , the achieved performance is varied based on the collection ( i.e. BMC or Twitter ) used for learning the vectors and the size of the vectors .
Conclusions
We have introduced our approach that adapts a phrase - based MT technique to normalise medical terms in Twitter messages .
We evaluate our proposed approach using a collection of phrases from tweets related to ADRs .
Our experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms an effective baseline by up to 55 % .
For future work , we aim to investigate the modelling of learned vector representation , such as CBOW and GloVe , within a phrase - based MT model when normalising medical terms .
