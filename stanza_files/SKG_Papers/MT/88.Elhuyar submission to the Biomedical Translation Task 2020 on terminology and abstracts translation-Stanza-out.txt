Elhuyar submission to the Biomedical Translation Task 2020 on terminology and abstracts translation
abstract
This article describes the systems submitted by Elhuyar to the 2020 Biomedical Translation Shared Task , specifically the systems presented in the subtasks of terminology translation for English -Basque and abstract translation for English -Basque and English - Spanish .
In all cases a Transformer architecture was chosen and we studied different strategies to combine open domain data with biomedical domain data for building the training corpora .
For the English - Basque pair , given the scarcity of parallel corpora in the biomedical domain , we set out to create domain training data in a synthetic way .
The systems presented in the terminology and abstract translation subtasks for the English - Basque language pair ranked first in their respective tasks among four participants , achieving 0.78 accuracy for terminology translation and a BLEU of 0.1279 for the translation of abstracts .
In the abstract translation task for the English - Spanish pair our team ranked second ( BLEU=0.4498 ) in the case of OK sentences .
Introduction General purpose translation systems usually perform poorly where domain specific knowledge is required ( Koehn and Knowles , 2017 ) .
Therefore , it is essential to develop translation systems for specific domains .
However , high quality parallel corpora for domain specific tasks are only available for a few major languages and obtaining in domain translated data for the majority of language pairs becomes a challenge .
With such scarcity of resources , various domain adaptation techniques have shown promising results , Saunders et al.
2019 , Sennrich et al. 2017 .
The biomedical domain is of great interest for the application of machine translation .
It is a sector of great importance in society , even more so after the advent of COVID -19 , where the handling of documentary information plays a major role .
Therefore , it is a scenario where machine translation can be of great help in order to facilitate the flow of information between different languages .
We can find different works in the literature that address the task of developing NMT systems adapted to the biomedical domain ( Yepes et al. , 2017 ; Sennrich et al. , 2017 ; Khan et al. , 2018 ) .
In contrast , few papers focus on language pairs where training data is scarce .
This is precisely the case of the task of translation from English to Basque .
The work of Soto et al . ( 2019 ) is specially relevant in this case , which presents a clinical domain oriented system for Basque -Spanish based on RNN and Transformer architectures and which does not require bilingual domain texts but only bilingual clinical terminology ( SNOMED CT ) .
Our participation in the Biomedical Translation Shared Task addresses the translation of biomedical terminology from English to Basque and the translation of biomedical abstracts from English to Basque and from English to Spanish .
Given the scarcity of real parallel biomedical domain corpora , our approach focused on different strategies to combine open domain data with in - domain biomedical data .
In the case of the English to Basque transla -
This article is structured as follows : the following section reviews the most relevant related works .
Section 3 describes the systems presented to the sub-tasks that include the English -Basque and English - Spanish pairs , as well as the results obtained in the experimentation .
Section 4 presents the results obtained in the official evaluation , and finally , we end the paper outlining the most relevant conclusions drawn from this work .
Related work Most of the related work on domain adaptation focuses on using either in-domain monolingual corpora , synthetically generated corpora or small parallel corpora .
Regarding in- domain monoligual corpora , Currey et al . ( 2017 ) analyze the benefits of augmenting available data by copying the target side monolingual data to source and training the system .
Results show significant gains in accuracy on named entities and words remaining identical in source and target languages .
Several studies show the effectiveness of generating synthetic parallel corpora for domain adaptation .
Sennrich et al. ( 2015 ) use the back translation technique with target monolingual data to strengthen the decoder , Zhang and Zong ( 2016 ) make use of source side monolingual data and Park et al . ( 2017 ) use both , source and target monolingual data to improve in-domain translations .
Finally , when in- domain parallel corpora is available , previous work focuses on mixed domain NMT systems by using both in - domain and out of domain data .
Chu et al. ( 2017 ) propose to use control tags to mark in - domain sentences prior to concatenating multiple domain corpora .
Sajjad et al. ( 2017 ) compare different methods for training a multi domain system , such as , concatenation , interactively training on different domains , selecting out of domain data close to the in domain data and ensembling different domain models .
Wang et al. ( 2017 ) exploit the internal sentence embeddings to find sentences that are close to in- domain data from out of domain data .
Several works in the literature address the task of developing NMT systems adapted to the biomedical domain .
Saunders et al. ( 2019 ) apply transfer learning technique by training on a large , general domain corpus and finetuning a series of systems on different biomedical domains .
They perform multi domain ensembling to further improve the results .
Khan et al. ( 2018 ) iteratively apply transfer learning on various biomedical domains .
Regarding works dealing with Basque the work of Soto et al . ( 2019 ) presents a clinical domain oriented system for Basque -Spanish based on RNN and Transformer architectures , which does not require bilingual domain texts but bilingual clinical terminology ( SNOMED CT ) .
They also analyse different back translation techniques .
Aimed at translating clinical terminology into Basque , we find the work of Perez-de Vi?aspre ( 2017 ) which proposes a system for translating SNOMED CT into Basque by combining lexical resources , transliteration of neoclassical terms , generation of nested terms and a domain- adapted RBMT system .
Experiments
In this section we describe the experiments carried out when training the translation systems .
We compare the results obtained by the systems on different open domain and in- domain test sets prior to selecting the best runs to submit for the biomedical translation task .
We also detail the Transformer architecture used and its parameters .
Datasets
For the experiments , we considered open domain general data and in- domain task specific data for fine-tuning purposes .
Open domain data comprises the publicly available Paracrawl v5 ( Espl ?
et al. , 2019 ) corpus for English - Spanish and a Elhuyar 's internal synthetic corpus for Basque -Spanish .
Due to the scarcity of in- domain data in the case of English - Basque , back translation has also been applied to generate synthetic examples .
Furthermore , we augmented training data by using monolingual Basque data gathered from artificially generated hospital notes , SNOMED - CT terminological content and Wikipedia biomedical articles .
We have created parallel data by copying the Basque sentences to source so that each source sentence is identical to the target sentence .
Table 1 offers a summary of the corpora used .
Architecture
For training the models the Transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) has been chosen .
Specifically , the Python implementation of the OpenNMT ( Klein et al. , 2017 ) library has been used .
Transformers are based on an encoder-decoder system with an attention mechanism .
Both the encoder and the decoder are composed of 6 layers composed in turn by a feed forward network and a multi-head attention mechanism .
Default values of the architecture without any optimization of the parameters have been applied .
The size of the recurrent neu -
To avoid the open vocabulary issue and for a better translation of unknown words , BPE tokenization ( Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) has been applied to source and target sequences .
Rare or unseen words are represented as a sequence of subword units .
In the case of Basque , this encoding is particularly useful as declensions generate a larger vocabulary .
EN -EU experiments
In this section we provide a detailed description of the experiments carried out for the English - Basque pair .
We describe the systems built and the results obtained on different test sets .
Looking for a robust experimental setup , we conducted both open domain and in-domain evaluation .
A brief description of the test sets can be found on Table 2 .
Systems
For the English - Basque pair we trained the following systems : Baseline1 .
A strong baseline by pivoting Elhuyar 's best out of domain EN - ES and ES - EU models .
These models are trained on the PCv5 corpus and a Elhuyar 's internal Spanish - Basque corpus respectively .
Baseline2 .
A further improvement of Baseline1 , by fine-tuning the EN - ES pivoting system with Medline and SCIELO in- domain biomedical data .
Baseline3 .
A previously available out of domain EN - EU system trained with back translated synthetic data .
Baseline4 .
A simple baseline trained with the task 's official in - domain data ( ICD - 10 corpus ) .
SystemA1 , SystemA2 and SystemA3 .
These systems are the result of fine-tuning Baseline3 with in - domain data .
SystemA1 uses a subset ( 250 k ) of ELH
Syn open domain corpus as well as shared task ICD - 10 in domain data .
A small portion of the ICD -10 corpus ( 1 k ) is used for validation .
Sys-temA2 is a variant of SystemA1 by adding more in domain data from the EHU books corpus .
A small subset of the EHU books corpus ( 1 k ) is also added to the validation set .
Finally , SystemA3 includes a subset ( 5 k ) of the out of domain ELH Syn corpus in the validation set in order to prevent the system from forgetting about prior out of domain knowledge .
SystemA4 .
A variant of SystemA3 using all the available ELH Syn open domain data .
SystemB1 .
This system was trained by adding synthetically generated EHU Syn in- domain data to the data used in SystemA4 .
To create synthetic data , a fine- tuned EU - EN model has been used to back translate an internal ES - EU biomedical corpus gathered from a collection of EHU books .
SystemB2 .
This system was trained by further augmenting data from SystemB1 with copied monolingual Basque target data from the shared task ( Hospital notes , SNOMED terminology and Wikipedia ) .
SystemC .
A variant of SystemB2 .
Synthetic Medline data from the WMT19 EN - ES biomedical shared task was added to the validation set to improve the performance on the Medline domain .
Results
Table 3 shows BLEU scores for the English to Basque experiments on out of domain and indomain test sets ( Table 2 ) .
As for abstract translation , SystemA4 , Sys-temB1 , SystemB2 and SystemC showed a significant improvement on those test sets when compared to the other trained systems .
In particular , SystemB2 obtained the best results on PRO test and SystemC the second best result .
The gap between SystemA4 and the other three SystemA 's showed that using all the available out of domain data helps avoiding the " catastrophic forgetting " phenomena , where all previous knowledge fades when learning new in- domain examples .
SystemB1 introduces in- domain synthetic data in the training process , which significantly improves the results on the EHU test .
This is due to the fact that synthetic data and the EHU test set share the same domain ( EHU biomedical books ) .
However , the drop on the PRO test is almost insignificant and it also improves all the baselines on the Synthetic test .
System B2 further improves the results on the PRO test set by adding monolingual corpora to the training data and SystemC shows the effect of the validation set by adding more biomedical domain data to the validation set .
Both systems improve all the baselines on every test set .
System B2 ( run1 ) , SystemC ( run2 ) and Baseline2 ( run3 ) were submitted as the best runs for the English to Basque abstract translation task .
Terminology translation task greatly differs from the abstract domain which can be clearly seen in the results .
In this case , the best results are obtained by SystemA1 which only includes a small part of the available out of domain data .
Furthermore , results are not distant from Baseline4 which was trained with ICD - 10 training data .
This behaviour shows the specificity of the task where previous complete sentence translation knowledge is not essential .
SystemA2 ( run1 ) , SystemA1 ( run2 ) and Base-line4 ( run3 ) were submitted as the best runs for the English to Basque terminology translation task .
EN -ES experiments
Below we present the different systems trained for the English - Spanish pair and the results obtained for each of them .
Systems
For the English - Spanish pair we trained the following systems : Baseline1 .
We have considered a strong baseline by using Elhuyar 's best out of domain EN - ES model .
This model was trained on the PCv5 corpus .
SystemA .
This model has been trained from scratch mixing in - domain and out domain data .
Indomain data comprises previous years ' shared tasks Medline data and a subset of the SCIELO dataset .
Out of domain data was obtained from the PCv5 corpus .
SystemA ' .
A variant of SystemA by averaging the three best performing checkpoints .
Results
Table 4 shows BLEU scores for the English to Spanish experiments on out of domain and in- domain test sets ( Table 2 ) .
SystemA improves the baseline on all the test sets and SystemA ' further improves those results obtaining the best results for the task .
Similar to the English to Basque abstract translation task , for the English to Spanish pair adding in - domain data and fine-tuning a previously trained out of domain system improved the results .
Furthermore , averaging the first three best checkpoints helped improving the results of the best checkpoint .
SystemA ' ( run1 ) , SystemA ( run2 ) and Baseline1 ( run3 ) were submitted as the best runs for the English to Spanish abstract translation task .
Official results
For the English to Basque abstract translation task we selected the PRO test as the most representative one when choosing the best runs for submission .
We assumed that this test set would be the closest to the official task test .
The EHU test set was also a great indicator of how robust our system was for the biomedical domain .
BLEU scores were calculated using the multieval tool and tokenization as provided in Moses .
Table 5 shows the performance of all the submitted runs for the official abstract translation test set .
Our submitted run2 has obtained the best score on the official task test , achieving a 0.1279 BLEU score .
When compared to other teams , all our submitted runs significantly outperform all the runs .
It is worth mentioning that our Baseline2 ( run3 ) which is based on pivoting between two systems ( EN - ES and ES - EU ) has obtained really close results which indicates that some biomedical knowledge was present in the Spanish to Basque system .
In the case of the terminology task , ICD - 10 test set is the official validation task and therefore the most representative one for choosing the best runs .
For the evaluation of terminology we provide two metrics : ( i ) accuracy , by relying on strict matches ( case insensitive ) between ground truth ans predictions ; and ( ii ) BLEU score , as measured by the NLTK module sentence bleu .
Table 6 shows the performance of all the submitted runs for the official terminology test set .
Our best submitted run has obtained the best score on the official task test , achieving 0.78 accuracy and a 0.7373 BLEU score .
When compared to other teams , all our submitted runs outperform all the runs , except for DCU MT 's run2 .
It is worth mentioning that out Baseline4 ( run3 ) which was trained on task 's English - Basque data has outperformed almost all of the others teams ' results .
This highlights the improvements obtained by our systems over the baseline .
Finally , for the English to Spanish abstract translation task WMT19 and WMT18 test sets were selected as reference for selecting the best runs .
Table 7 shows the performance of all the submitted runs for the official English to Spanish abstract translation test set .
Our best submitted run has obtained the fifth best score on all sentences achieving a 0.4364 BLEU score and the second best team with OK sentences ( BLEU=0.4498 ) .
In this case , our submitted baseline ( run3 ) also shows a great robustness , indicating some prior biomedical domain knowledge .
Conclusions
For the Biomedical Translation Task 2020 , we considered several strategies combining open domain and in-domain biomedical data .
We have successfully applied transfer learning by fine-tuning a previously available open domain system with in- domain specific data .
To tackle the scarcity of English - Basque domain data , we have performed data augmentation by back translating real data .
The systems submitted for the terminology and abstract translation tasks for the English - Basque pair have ranked first on the official task test , achieving 0.78 accuracy for terminology translation and a BLEU of 0.1279 for the translation of abstracts .
For the English to Spanish abstract translation task our systems have obtained competitive enough results , being the second team for OK sentences ( BLEU=0.4498 ) .
In all cases , even developed baselines have achieved outstanding results .
For the English - Spanish task , Paracrawl v5 has proven to be a robust baseline for biomedical domain systems , as it seems to contain some biomedical crawled websites .
For the English - Basque task , fine - tuning one of the pivoting pairs ( EN - ES ) we have created a robust baseline for the biomedical domain .
Adding monolingual corpora to the training data , as copied target , seems to improve the decoder by adapting the systems to better perform on domain specific terminology .
Even though some noise is introduced by copying the target to the source side , the results are improved .
Terminology task showed promising results when translating biomedical domain terms , which could lead to a production ready system .
Table 1 : 1 Size of corpora used for training the systems .
ral network of each layer is 512 .
Thus , 512 size embeddings have been used for both source and target sentences .
Adam optimizer has been used during the training , and a learning - rate of 2 with a warm - up phase of 8000 steps .
The dropout ratio is 0.1 and the batch size is 4096 sentences .
All models have been trained until the results on the development set stopped improving .
