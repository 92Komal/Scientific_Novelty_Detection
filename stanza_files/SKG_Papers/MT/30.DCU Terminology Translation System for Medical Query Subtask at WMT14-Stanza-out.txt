Introduction
This paper describes the terminology translation system developed at Dublin City University for our participation in the query translation subtask at the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation ( WMT14 ) .
We developed six kinds of terminology extraction methods for the problem of medical terminology translation , especially where rare and new words are considered .
We have several motivations which we address before providing a description of the actual algorithms undeprinning our work .
First , terminology translation cannot be seen just as a simple extension of the translation process if we use an analogy from human translation .
Terminology translation can be considered as more important and a quite different task than translation per se , so we need a considerably different way of solving this particular problem .
Bilingual terminology selection has been claimed to be the touchstone in human translation , especially where scientific and legal translation are concerned .
Terminology selection is often the hardest and most time - consuming process in the translation workflow .
Depending on the particular requirements of the use-case ( Way , 2013 ) , users may not object to disfluent translations , but will invariably be very sensitive to the wrong selection of terminology , even if the meaning of the chosen terms is correct .
This is especially true if this selected terminology does not match with that preferred by the users themselves , in which case users are likely to express some kind of complaint ; it may even be that the entire translation is rejected as sub-standard or inappropriate on such grounds .
Second , we look at how to handle new and rare words .
If we inspect the process of human translation more closely , it is easy to identify several differences compared to the methods used in statistical MT ( SMT ) .
Unless stipulated by the client , the selection of bilingual terminology can be a highly subjective process .
Accordingly , it is not necessarily the bilingual term-pair with the highest probability that is chosen by the human translator .
It is often the case that statistical methods often forget about or delete less frequent n-grams , but rely on more frequent n-grams using maximum likelihood or Maximum A Priori ( MAP ) methods .
If some terminology is highly suitable , a human translator can use it quite freely .
Furthermore , there are a lot of new words in reality for which new target equivalents have to be created by the translators themselves , so the question arises as to how human translators actually select appropriate new terminology .
Transliteration , which is often supported by many Asian languages including Hindi , Japanese , and Chinese , is perhaps the easiest things to do under such circumstances .
Slight modifications of alphabets / accented characters can sometimes successfully create a valid new term , even for European languages .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 describes our algorithms .
Our decoding strategy in Section 3 .
Our experimen- tal settings and results are presented in Section 4 , and we conclude in Section 5 .
Our Methods Apart from the conventional statistical approach to extract bilingual terminology , this medical query task reminds us of two frequently occurring problems which are often ignored : ( i ) " Can we forget about terminology which occurs only once in a corpus ? " , and ( ii ) " What can we do if the terminology does not occur in a corpus ? "
These two problems require computationally quite different approaches than what is usually done in the standard statistical approach .
Furthermore , the medical query task in WMT14 provides a wide range of corpora : parallel and monolingual corpora , as well as dictionaries .
These two interesting aspects motivate our extraction methods which we present in this section , including one relatively new Machine Learning algorithm of zero-shot learning arising from recent developments in the neural network community ( Bengio et al. , 2000 ; Mikolov et al. , 2013 b ) .
Translation Model Word alignment ( Brown et al. , 1993 ) and phrase extraction ( Koehn et al. , 2003 ) can capture bilingual word - and phrase - pairs with a good deal of accuracy .
We omit further details of these standard methods which are freely available elsewhere in the SMT literature ( e.g. ( Koehn , 2010 ) ) .
( Okita et al. , 2010 ) addressed the problem of capturing bilingual term-pairs from parallel data which might otherwise not be detected by the translation model .
Hence , the requirement in Okita et al. is not to use SMT / GIZA ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003 ) to extract term-pairs , which are the common focus in this medical query translation task .
Extraction from Parallel Corpora
The classical algorithm of ( Kupiec , 1993 ) used in ( Okita et al. , 2010 ) counts the statistics of terminology c(e term i , f term j |s t ) on the source and the target sides which jointly occur in a sentence s t after detecting candidate terms via POS tagging , which are then summed up over the entire corpus N t=1 c( e term i , f term j |s t ) .
Then , the algorithm adjusts the length of e term i and f term j .
It can be said that this algorithm captures termpairs which occur rather frequently .
However , this apparent strength can also be seen in disadvantageous terms since the search for terminology occurs densely in each of the sentences which increases the computational complexity of this algorithm , and causes the method to take a considerable time to run .
Furthermore , if we suppose that most frequent term-pairs are to be extracted via a standard translation model ( as described briefly in the previous section ) , our efforts to search among frequent pairs is not likely to bring about further gain .
It is possible to approach this in a reverse manner : " less frequent pairs can be outstanding term candidates " .
Accordingly , if our aim changes to capture only those less frequent pairs , the situation changes dramatically .
The number of terms we need to capture is considerably decreased .
Many sentences do not include any terminology at all , and only a relatively small subset of sentences includes a few terms , such that term-pairs become sparse with regard to sentences .
Term-pairs can be found rather easily if a candidate term-pair cooccurs on the source and the target sides and on the condition that the items in the term-pair actually correspond with one another .
This condition can be easily checked in various ways .
One way is to translate the source side of the targeted pairs with the alignment option in the Moses decoder ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) , which we did in this evaluation campaign .
Another way is to use asupervised aligner , such as the Berkeley aligner ( Haghighi et al. , 2009 ) , to align the targeted pairs and check whether they are actually aligned or not .
We assume two predefined sets of terms at the outset , E term = {e term 1 , . . . , e termn } and F term = {f term 1 , . . . , f termn }.
We search for possible alignment links between the term- pair only when they co-occur in the same sentence .
One obvious advantage of this approach is the computational complexity which is fairly low .
Note that the result of ( Okita et al. , 2010 ) shows that the frequency - based approach of ( Kupiec , 1993 ) worked well for NTCIR patent terminology ( Fujii et al. , 2010 ) , which otherwise would have been difficult to capture via the traditional SMT / GIZA ++ method .
In contrast , however , this did not work well on the Europarl corpus ( Koehn , 2005 ) .
Terminology Dictionaries
Terminology dictionaries themselves are obviously among the most important resources for bilingual term-pairs .
In this medical query translation subtask , two corpora are provided for this purpose : ( i ) Unified Medical Language System corpus ( UMLS corpus ) , 1 and ( ii ) Wiki entries .
2
Extraction from Terminology Dictionaries : lower-order n-grams Terminology dictionaries provide reliable higherorder n-gram pairs .
However , they do not often provide the correspondences between the lowerorder n-grams contained therein .
For example , the UMLS corpus provides a term-pair of " abdominal compartment syndrome ||| syndrome du compartiment abdominal " ( EN | | | FR ) .
However , such terminology dictionaries often do not explicitly provide the correspondent pairs " abdominal ||| abdominal " ( EN | | | FR ) or " syndrome ||| syndrome " ( EN | | | FR ) .
Clearly , these terminology dictionaries implicitly provide the correspondent pairs .
Note that UMLS and Wiki entries provide terminology dictionaries .
Hence , it is possible to obtain some suggestion by higher order n-gram models if we know their alignments between words on the source and target sides .
Algorithm 1 shows the overall procedure .
Algorithm 1 Lower-order n-gram extraction algorithm 1 : Perform monolingual word alignment for higher - order n-gram pairs .
2 : Collect only the reliable alignment pairs ( i.e. discard unreliable alignment pairs ) .
3 : Extract the lower -order word pairs of our interest .
Extraction from Monolingual Corpora : Transliteration and Abbreviation Monolingual corpora can be used in various ways , including :
1 . Transliteration : Many languages support the fundamental mechanism of between European and Asian languages .
Japanese even supports a special alphabet - katakana - for this purpose .
Chinese and Hindi also permit transliteration using their own alphabets .
However , even among European languages , this mechanism makes it possible to find possible translation counterparts for a given term .
In this query task , we did this only for the French - to - English direction and only for words containing accented characters ( by rule- based conversion ) .
2 . Abbreviation :
It is often the case that abbreviations should be resolved in the same language .
If the translation includes some abbreviation , such as " C. difficile " , this needs to be investigated exhaustively in the same language .
However , in the specific domain of medical terminology , it is quite likely that possible phrase matches will be successfully identified .
Extraction from Monolingual Corpora : Zero-Shot Learning Algorithm 2
Algorithm to connect two word embedding space 1 : Prepare the monolingual source and target sentences .
2 : Prepare the dictionary which consists of U entries of source and target sentences among non-stop-words .
3 : Train the neural network language model on the source side and obtain the continuous space real vectors of X dimensions for each word .
4 : Train the neural network language model on the target side and obtain the continuous space real vectors of X dimensions for each word .
5 : Using the real vectors obtained in the above steps , obtain the linear mapping between the dictionary in two continuous spaces using canonical component analysis ( CCA ) .
Another interesting terminology extraction method requires neither parallel nor comparable corpora , but rather just monolingual corpora on both sides ( possibly unrelated to each other ) together with a small amount of dictionary entries which provide already known correspondences between words on the source and target sides ( henceforth , we refer to this as the ' dictionary ' ) .
This method uses the recently developed zero-shot learning ( Palatucci et al. , 2009 ) using neural network language modelling ( Bengio et al. , 2000 ; Mikolov et al. , 2013 b ) .
Then , we train both sides with the neural network language model , and use a continuous space representation to project words to each other on the basis of a small amount of correspondences in the dictionary .
If we assume that each continuous space is linear ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 c ) , we can connect them via linear projection ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 b ) .
Algorithm 2 shows this situation .
In our experiments we use U the same as the entries of Wiki and X as 50 .
Algorithm 3 shows the algorithm to extract the counterpart of OOV words .
Algorithm 3 Algorithm to extract the counterpart of OOV words .
1 : Prepare the projection by Algorithm 2 .
2 : Detect unknown words in the translation outputs .
3 : Do the of it ( the source word ) into the target word using the trained linear mappings in the training step .
Decoding Strategy
We deploy six kinds of extraction methods : ( 1 ) translation model , ( 2 ) extraction from parallel corpora , ( 3 ) terminology dictionaries , ( 4 ) lower -order n-grams , ( 5 ) transliteration and abbreviation , and ( 6 ) zero-shot learning .
Among these we deploy four of them -( 2 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) - in a limited context , while the remaining two are used without any context , mainly owing to time constraints ; only when we did not find the correspondent pairs via ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , did we complement this by the other methods .
The detected bilingual term-pairs using ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) can be combined using various methods .
One way is to employ a method similar to ( confusion network - based ) system combination ( Okita and van Genabith , 2011 ; Okita and van Genabith , 2012 ) .
First we make a lattice : if we regard one candidate of ( 1 ) and two candidates in ( 3 ) as translation outputs where the words of two candidates in ( 3 ) are connected using an underscore ( i.e. one word ) , we can make a lattice .
Then , we can deploy monotonic decoding over them .
If we do this for the devset and then apply it to the test set , we can incorporate a possible preference learnt from the development set , i.e. whether the query translator prefers method ( 1 ) or UMLS / Wiki translation .
MERT process and language model are applied in a similar manner with ( confusion network - based ) system combination ( cf. ( Okita and van Genabith , 2011 ) ) .
We note also that a lattice structure is useful for handling grammatical coordination .
Since queries are formed by real users , reserved words for database query such as " AND " ( or " ET " ( FR ) ) and " OR " ( or " OU " ( FR ) ) are frequently observed in the test set .
Furthermore , there is repeated use of " and " more than twice , for example " douleur abnominal et Helicobacter pylori et cancer " , which makes it very difficult to detect the correct coordination boundaries .
The lattice on the input side can express such ambiguity at the cost of splitting the source -side sentence in a different manner .
Experimental Results
The baseline is obtained in the following way .
The GIZA ++ implementation ( Och and Ney , 2003 ) of IBM Model 4 is used as the baseline for word alignment : Model 4 is incrementally trained by performing 5 iterations of Model 1 , 5 iterations of HMM , 3 iterations of Model 3 , and 3 iterations of Model 4 .
For phrase extraction the grow-diagfinal heuristics described in ( Koehn et al. , 2003 ) is used to derive the refined alignment from bidirectional alignments .
We then perform MERT ( Och , 2003 ) which optimizes parameter settings using the BLEU metric ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) , while a 5 gram language model is derived with Kneser - Ney smoothing ( Kneser and Ney , 1995 ) trained using SRILM ( Stolcke , 2002 ) .
We use the whole training corpora including the WMT14 translation task corpora as well as medical domain data .
UMLS and Wikipedia are used just as training corpora for the baseline .
For the extraction from parallel corpora ( cf. Section 2.2 ) , we used Genia tagger ( Tsuruoka and Tsujii , 2005 ) and the Berkeley parser ( Petrov and Klein , 2007 ) .
For the zero-shot learning ( cf. Section 2.6 ) we used scikit learn ( Pedregosa et al. , 2011 ) , word2vec ( Mikolov et al. , 2013a ) , and a recurrent neural network ( Mikolov , 2012 ) .
Other tools used are in-house software .
Table 2 shows the results for the FR - EN query task .
We obtained 36.2 BLEU points absolute , which is an improvement of 6.3 BLEU point absolute ( 21.1 % relative ) over the baseline .
Table 3 shows the results for the EN - FR query task .
We obtained 28.8 BLEU points absolute , which is an improvement of 8.7 BLEU points abso-lute ( 43 % relative ) over the baseline .
Our system was the best system for both of these tasks .
These improvements over the baseline were statistically significant by a paired bootstrap test ( Koehn , 2004 ) , " medical " indicates a language model built on all the medical corpora while " WMT " indicates a language model built on all the non-medical corpora .
Note that some sentence in testset can be considered as non-medical domain .
Extraction methods ( 1 ) -( 6 ) correspond to those described in Section 2.1 - 2.6 .
Table 4 shows the results for CLIR task .
We obtained 51.8 BLEU points absolute , which is an improvement of 9.4 BLEU point absolute ( 22.2 % relative ) over the baseline .
Although CLIR task allowed 10 - best lists , our submission included only 1 - best list .
This resulted in the score of P@5 of 0.348 and P@10 of 0.346 which correspond to the second place , despite a good result in terms of BLEU .
This is since unlike BLEU score P@5 and P@10 measure whether the whole elements in reference and hypothesis are matched or not .
We noticed that our submission included a lot of near miss sentences only in terms of capitalization : " abnominal pain and Helicobacter pylori and cancer " ( reference ) and " abnominal pain and helicobacter pylori and cancer " ( submission ) .
These are counted as incorrect in terms of P@5 and P@10 .
3 Noted that after submission we obtained the revised score of P@5 of 0.560 and P@10 of 0.560 with the same method but with 2 - best lists which handles the capitalization varieties .
