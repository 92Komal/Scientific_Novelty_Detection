Introduction
The EMNLP 2011 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation ( WMT - 2011 ) took place on Saturday and Sunday , July 30 - 31 in Edinburgh , Scotland , immediately following the Conference on Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing ( EMNLP ) 2011 , which was hosted by the University of Edinburgh .
WMT 5 - year Retrospective Best Paper Award Since this is the Sixth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation , we have decided to create a WMT 5 - year Retrospective Best Paper Award , to be given to the best paper that was published at the first Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation , which was held at HLT - NAACL 2006 in New York .
The goals of this retrospective award are to recognize high-quality work that has stood the test of time , and to highlight the excellent work that appears at WMT .
The WMT11 program committee voted on the best paper from a list of six nominated papers .
Five of these were nominated by high citation counts , which we defined as having 10 or more citations in the ACL anthology network ( excluding self-citations ) , and more than 30 citations on Google Scholar .
We also opened the nomination process to the committee , which yielded one further nomination for a paper that did not reach the citation threshold but was deemed to be excellent .
This short paper described Zollmann and Venugopal 's entry into the WMT06 shared translation task .
Their system introduced a parsing - based machine translation system .
Like David Chiang 's Hiero system , Zollmann and Venugopal 's system used synchronous context free grammars ( SCFGs ) .
Instead of using a single non-terminal symbol , X , Zollmann and Venugopal 's SCFG rules contained linguistically informed non-terminal symbols that were extracted from a parsed parallel corpus .
This paper was one of the first publications to demonstrate that syntactically - informed approaches to statistical machine translation could achieve translation quality that was comparable to - or even better than - state - of - the - art phrase - based and and hierarchical phrase - based approaches to machine translation .
Zollmann and Venugopal 's approach has influenced a number of researchers , and has been integrated into open source translation software like the Joshua and Moses decoders .
In many ways this paper represents the ideals of the WMT workshops .
It introduced a novel approach to machine translation and demonstrated its value empirically by comparing it to other state - of - the - art systems on a public data set .
Congratulations to Andreas Zollmann and Ashish Venugopal for their excellent work !
