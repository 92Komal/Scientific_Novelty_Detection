Introduction
The Joint Fifth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation and MetricsMATR ( WMT10 ) took place on July 15 and 16 in Uppsala , Sweden , immediately following the 48th conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics ( ACL ) .
This is the sixth time this workshop has been held .
The focus of our workshop was to evaluate the state of the art in machine translation for a variety of languages .
Recent experimentation has shown that the performance of machine translation systems varies greatly with the source language .
In this workshop we encouraged researchers to investigate ways to improve the performance of machine translation systems for diverse languages .
Prior to the workshop , in addition to soliciting relevant papers for review and possible presentation we conducted a shared task that brought together machine translation systems for an evaluation on previously unseen data .
The shared task also included a track for evaluation metrics and system combination methods .
The results of the shared task were announced at the workshop , and these proceedings also include an overview paper that summarizes the results , as well as provides information about the data used and any procedures that were followed in conducting or scoring the task .
In addition , there are short papers from each participating team that describe their underlying system in some detail .
Like in previous years , we have received a far larger number of submission than we could accept for presentation .
This year we have received 24 full paper submissions .
15 full papers were selected for oral presentation and one for poster presentation .
We received 7 short paper submissions for the evaluation task , 9 short paper submissions for the system combination task , and 30 short paper submissions for the translation task .
Due to the large number of high quality submission for the full paper track , shared task submissions were presented as posters .
The poster session gave participants of the shared task the opportunity to present their approaches .
The invited talk was given by Hermann Ney ( RWTH Aachen ) .
We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews .
We also would like to thank the participants of the shared task and all the other volunteers who helped with the manual evaluations .

The first time was in 2005 as part of the ACL 2005 Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts .
In the following years the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation was held at HLT - NAACL 2006 in New York City , USA , at ACL 2007 in Prague , Czech Republic , at ACL 2008 in Columbus , Ohio , USA , and at EACL 2009 in Athens , Greece .
MetricsMATR was previously held in conjunction with AMTA 2008 in Honolulu , Hawaii , USA .
