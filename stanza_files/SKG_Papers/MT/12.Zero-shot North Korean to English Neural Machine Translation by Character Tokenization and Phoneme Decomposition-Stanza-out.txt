Zero-shot North Korean to English Neural Machine Translation by Character Tokenization and Phoneme Decomposition
abstract
The primary limitation of North Korean to English translation is the lack of a parallel corpus ; therefore , high translation accuracy cannot be achieved .
To address this problem , we propose a zero-shot approach using South Korean data , which are remarkably similar to North Korean data .
We train a neural machine translation model after tokenizing a South Korean text at the character level and decomposing characters into phonemes .
We demonstrate that our method can effectively learn North Korean to English translation and improve the BLEU scores by + 1.01 points in comparison with the baseline .
Introduction Neural machine translation ( NMT ) has been adapted to many languages ; however , machine translation of the North Korean language 1 has seldom been performed .
One of the reasons is the lack of large-scale bilingual data for training North Korean neural models .
It is known that large-scale bilingual data are required to improve the translation accuracy of an NMT model .
For example , one of the previous works suggests that an NMT system is less accurate than a phrase - based statistical machine translation system if there are no more than 100 million words in the bilingual training data ( Koehn and Knowles , 2017 ) .
There are three approaches to solve low language resource bottleneck .
First , Wang et al. ( 2006 ) proposed a method to train a translation model using a pivot language as an intermediate language .
This approach translates from the source language to 1 Korean is a language mainly used in the Korean peninsula ; however , there are some grammatical differences between the Republic of Korea and the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea .
In this study , we refer to the Korean language used in the Republic of Korea as " South Korean , " and the Korean language used in the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea as " North Korean . " the pivot language and from the pivot language to the target language .
However , there is no good pivot language between North Korean and English .
Second , Johnson et al. ( 2017 ) proposed a many - tomany translation model , where multiple languages are translated into other languages using a single shared encoder and decoder .
They demonstrated that this model can translate a language pair that is unseen in training data .
However , North Korean does not have any bilingual data between any languages .
Third , Marujo et al. ( 2011 ) proposed a rulebased method to convert similar languages into a target language , such as Brazilian Portuguese to European Portuguese , and extended the target language resources .
North Korean is a language remarkably similar to South Korean , but conversion from South Korean to North Korean needs to be determined considering the context , which makes rule-based conversion difficult .
Therefore , in this study , we propose a method to tokenize South Korean input sentences at the character level and decompose them into phonemes to mitigate the grammatical differences between South Korean and North Korean , and demonstrate that the translation model from North Korean to English can be effectively learned using bilingual South Korean - English data .
The main contributions of this study are as follows .
?
Because there is no evaluation dataset between North Korean and English , we create a North Korean - English evaluation dataset by manually translating the South Korean - English bilingual evaluation dataset into a North Korean one . ?
We demonstrate that the North Korean- English translation model can be trained effectively on bilingual South Korean - English data by character - level tokenization and phonemelevel decomposition .
Related Work
The pivot language approach increases the translation error between the source language and the target language , because the translation model of each language is independently trained .
addressed this problem by allowing interaction during the translation model training .
Moreover , proposed a method to train a source - to - target model using a pretrained teacher model as its guide .
Marujo et al. ( 2011 ) proposed a rule-based method to convert similar languages into a target language to extend the language resources of the target side .
Wang et al. ( 2016 ) presented a method to extract the conversion rules between similar languages .
Firat et al. ( 2016 ) proposed a many - to -many translation model with several encoders and decoders .
However , the accuracy of a many - to -many translation model with a single shared encoder and decoder was found to be higher ( Johnson et al. , 2017 ) .
Finally , the translation accuracy was improved by preprocessing of the bilingual data .
Zhang and Komachi ( 2018 ) demonstrated that higher translation accuracy can be obtained by decomposing Kanji into ideographic characters and strokes in Japanese - Chinese NMT .
Stratos ( 2017 ) proposed a speech - parsing model for South Korean with character - level tokenization and decomposition into phonemes , demonstrating an improvement in the speech - parsing accuracy .
3 South - North Differences in the Korean Language
Grammatical differences
The two Korean languages have grammatical differences , including differences in word segmentation ( WS ) , initial sound rule ( ISR ) , and compound words .
Table 1 presents examples of grammatical differences between South Korean and North Korean words or phrases that have the same meaning .
We only consider the differences in the WS and ISR in our study , as differences in compound words in the evaluation data rarely appear .
Word segmentation .
South Korean and North Korean differ in the way to tokenize words containing formal and proper nouns and in quantitative expressions .
For example , words are separated in both South Korean and North Korean when particles appear ; however , they are not separated in North Korean if the next word after a particle is a formal noun .
In Table 1 , the word meaning " many things " is written as " ? ? " in South Korean and is separated because " ? " is a particle .
However , since " ? " is a formal noun , it is written consecutively in North Korean as " ?. "
To convert WS from South Korean grammar to North Korean grammar , it is necessary to consider the context .
Initial sound rule .
In South Korean , a consonant " ? " changes into " ? " or " ? " when it is combined with " ? , ? , ? , ? , ? , ? , ? , " or other vowels , whereas it does not change in North Korean .
For example , the word that means " basketball " in Table 1 is represented as " ? " in South Korean because of the ISR , but is represented as " ? " in North Korean .
Additionally , some South Korean words become polysemous owing to the ISR .
In Table 1 , the words that mean " fulfillment " and " move " both become " ? " in South Korean , but remain " ? " and " ? " in North Korean , respectively .
It is difficult to mitigate the difference in the ISR without considering the context .
Creating North Korean Evaluation Data We
Korean Neural Machine Translation using Character Tokenization and Phoneme Decomposition
We propose a method to tokenize input sentences into characters or decompose them into phonemes .
Using this method , it is possible to reduce the influence of grammatical differences between South Korean and North Korean to train a machine translation model in North Korean using bilingual South Korean data .
In the following South Korean or North Korean sentences , we indicate the word boundary as ? for better understanding .
Character model .
In character level tokenization , we split each word into characters .
For example , the word that means " many things " in Table 1 is written as " ? " in South Korean and " ? ? " in North Korean , but when we tokenize it at the character level , it becomes " ? , " and there is no difference between the two languages .
Therefore , character level tokenization can overcome the difference in WS to some extent .
characters in a word into phonemes ( vowels and consonants ) .
As a result , we can reduce the effect of ISR .
For example , the word " basketball " is written as " ? " in South Korean and " ? " in North Korean ; therefore , only one out of two tokens are common at the character level .
When they are decomposed into phonemes , the former is " ? " in South Korean , and the latter is " ? " in North Korean , resulting in four out of five tokens being common .
In this way , decomposition into phonemes can reduce the effect of ISR .
Word
In addition , we retain the word or phrase boundary in the input sentence in this model .
For example , when decomposing the sentence " ? ? " into phonemes , it is decomposed as " ?. "
By applying byte-pair encoding ( BPE , Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) to the sentence that has been decomposed into phonemes , it is possible to segment the sentence at the phoneme level while considering word or phrase boundaries .
Character ( phoneme BPE ) model .
In character ( phoneme BPE ) tokenization , we tokenize a sentence at the character level and decompose it into phonemes .
Tokenization at the character level and decomposition into phonemes can mitigate the differences in WS and ISR , and it is possible to combine both .
For example , when the sentence " ? " is tokenized at the character level and decomposed into phonemes , it becomes " ?. "
By applying BPE to this sentence , it is possible to segment the sentence at the phoneme level while considering character boundaries .
Experiment
Settings
We train a BiDeep recurrent neural network using Nematus 3 for implementation .
We adjust the hyperparameters as in Sennrich and Zhang ( 2019 ) ( Table 2 ) .
We use a News Korean - English parallel corpus for training the model and convert it into North Korean grammar ( 3.2 ) for evaluating the model .
We perform tokenization and truecasing using Moses scripts for all the input sentence pairs .
We delete sentences with more than 200 words from the training data .
Table 3 presents the training , development , and test data statistics .
In the evaluation , we perform detruecasing and detokenization for the translation outputs using Moses script and evaluate the bilingual evaluation understudy ( BLEU ) score using sacreBLEU ( Post , 2018 ) .
We select the model using South Korean and North Korean development data .
In this study , in addition to the word level data of South Korean and North Korean as input languages , we use the four preprocessing methods , which are described in the following paragraphs and presented in Table 5 . Sennrich and Zhang ( 2019 ) , we apply character level BPE to each of the South Korean , North Korean , and English sides that had been split with words .
We set the merge operation to 30 k and the frequency threshold to 10 .
For the following South Korean and North Korean preprocessing steps , the English side used only the word ( character BPE ) model .
In addition to our re-implementation of Sennrich and Zhang ( 2019 ) , we cite the BLEU score reported in their paper .
Word ( character BPE ) model .
According to Character model .
We perform character level tokenization .
As for English and Hanja included in the South Korean and North Korean data , we treat them as words without further tokenization .
In addition , we limit the token types to a maximum frequency of 1,700 .
Word ( phoneme BPE ) model .
We decompose the words into phonemes and apply BPE .
We set the merge operation to 30 k and the frequency threshold to 10 .
We use hgtk ( Hangul toolkit ) 4 for the decomposition into phonemes .
Character ( phoneme BPE ) model .
We perform the character level tokenization , decomposition into phonemes , and application of BPE .
We set the merge operation to 1k .
Results
Table 4 presents the BLEU scores for the evaluation data .
In the cases of both the South Korean and North Korean languages , the char ( phonBPE ) models achieved the highest scores in the dev data .
The test data reveals an improvement of + 0.67 points for South Korean and + 1.01 points for North Korean in comparison with the word ( charBPE ) model , respectively .

The word that means " financial help " is written as " ? ? " in South Korean , and in North Korean , it is written consecutively as " ?. "
Additionally , in South Korean , the word that means " federal " becomes " ? " because of the head ISR but remains " ? " in North Korean .

Discussion
We extract two subsets that have differences in the WS or ISR in the test data to test the hypothesis that each preprocessing step can absorb the grammatical differences .
Table 3 presents the WS and ISR subset data statistics .
Output of each model .
Table 6 presents the outputs of each model .
The words that include grammatical differences , such as " ? " and " ? ? , " are not well - translated in the word - based models .
However , the character - based models can translate them correctly .
Character - level tokenization can mitigate both grammatical differences as shown in the example of Table 6 ; however , character - level tokenization cannot solve all the grammatical differences .
For example , Table 7 presents an example , wherein the word " ? " is affected by the ISR , and only the char ( phonBPE ) model can translate it in North Korean translation .
Therefore , tokenization at the character level and decomposition into phonemes are necessary to reduce the differences of the WS and ISR .
Word segmentation .
Human evaluation
We randomly extracted 50 lines from each model output in the North Korean to English test .
Three evaluators evaluated the fluency and adequacy on a scale of 1 - 5 .
Table 8 presents the results of the human evaluation .
The char ( phonBPE ) model exhibits the highest scores in both metrics , with an improvement of + 0.11 points in the fluency evaluation and + 0.02 points in the adequacy evaluation in comparison with the word ( charBPE ) model .
Additionally , the human evaluation results indicate that character tokenization and phoneme decomposition can improve the accuracy of the North Korean to English translation .
Conclusions and Future Work
In this study , to solve the language resource bottleneck in North Korean translation , we proposed a method to tokenize input sentences in South Korean and North Korean at the character level and decompose them into phonemes .
This method is simple and mitigates the grammatical differences between South Korean and North Korean ; moreover , the method demonstrates improvement in translation accuracy for North Korean to English translation .
However , the differences that exist between South Korean and North Korean are not only grammatical ones .
There are some words that have the same pronunciation and notation but different meanings .
For example , the meaning of " ? " is " squid " in South Korean , but " octopus " in North Korean .
Therefore , the differences in word meanings are a major challenge .
In the future , we intend to use the English translation data of North Korean news articles to create an evaluation dataset that considers differences in words , and attempt to develop a translation method using a language model with context , such as BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) .
