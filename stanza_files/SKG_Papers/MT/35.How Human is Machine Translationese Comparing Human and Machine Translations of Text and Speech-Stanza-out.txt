How Human is Machine Translationese ?
Comparing Human and Machine Translations of Text and Speech
abstract
Translationese is a phenomenon present in human translations , simultaneous interpreting , and even machine translations .
Some translationese features tend to appear in simultaneous interpreting with higher frequency than in human text translation , but the reasons for this are unclear .
This study analyzes translationese patterns in translation , interpreting , and machine translation outputs in order to explore possible reasons .
In our analysis we ( i ) detail two non-invasive ways of detecting translationese and ( ii ) compare translationese across human and machine translations from text and speech .
We find that machine translation shows traces of translationese , but does not reproduce the patterns found in human translation , offering support to the hypothesis that such patterns are due to the model ( human vs. machine ) rather than to the data ( written vs. spoken ) .
Introduction
In recent years , a growing body of work has pointed to the presence , across different genres and domains , of a set of relevant linguistic patterns with respect to syntax , semantics and discourse of human translations .
Such patterns make translations more similar to each other than to texts in the same genre and style originally authored in the target language .
These patterns are together called " translationese " ( Teich , 2003 ; Volansky et al. , 2015 ) .
Linguists classify translationese in two main categories : ( i ) source 's interference , or shining - though as put forward by Teich ( 2003 ) .
For example , a translation replicating a syntactic pattern which is typical of the source language , and rare in the target language , displays a typical form of shiningthrough ; ( ii ) aherence or over-adherence to the target language 's standards , that is normalisation .
For example , translating a sentence displaying marked order in the source with a sentence displaying standard order in the target it a typical example of overnormalization .
Nonetheless , translationese 's main causes remain unclear ( Koppel and Ordan , 2011 ; Schmied and Sch?ffler , 1996 ) .
Translationese displays different patterns depending on the translation 's mode and register : a typical example is simultaneous interpreting , which shows translationese patterns distinct from those observed in written translations ( Bernardini et al. , 2016 ) .
We can interpret differences as either ( i ) an effect of the limitations of the human language apparatus that constrain translations , ( ii ) an inevitable effect of the structural and semantic differences between languages ; or ( iii ) a combination of the two .
To test these hypotheses , it is common to compare human translations ( HT ) produced under different circumstances , e.g. written translation versus simultaneous interpreting , following the assumption that , if translationese is a product of human cognitive limitations , translations produced under higher cognitive constrains should present more evident translationese symptoms .
Machine translation ( MT ) does not have any human cognitive limitation , but current state - of - the - art systems learn to translate using human data , which is affected by translationese .
On the other hand , unlike human translators , most standard modern MT systems still work at the level of individual sentences ( rather than document or dialog ) unaware of the surrounding co-text and context .
Taking these observations into account , this paper explores the following research questions : Q1 . Does machine translation replicate the translationese differences observed between text and speech in human translation ?
Q2 . Do different machine translation architectures learn differently enough to display distinctive translationese patterns ?
We study translationese in speech and writ-ten text by comparing human and machine translations to original documents .
Specifically , we present a comparison between three MT architectures and the human translation of spoken and written language in German and English , exploring the question of whether MT replicates the differences observed in human data between text - based and interpreting - based translationese .
While some aspects of translationese tend to appear in simultaneous translation of speech with higher frequency than in translation of text , it is unclear whether such patterns are data - or modeldependent .
Since machine translation does not have the cognitive limitations humans have ( in terms of memory , online processing , etc. ) , MT systems should fail to replicate the differences between text and speech translationese observed in human translations , if such differences are due to the limits of human cognitive capacities .
Assuming that MT engines are trained only on translated texts and not on simultaneous interpreting , so that they cannot simply learn to mimic interpreting 's translationese signal , the differences between text and speech translationese observed in human translation vs .
interpreting are not expected to the same extent in MT if they are an effect of human cognitive limitations .
If , on the other hand , translationese patterns in text and speech are due to characteristics inherent in the two modes of expression , MT systems ' translationese patterns should mimic human translationese patterns .
The paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 presents related work .
Section 3 introduces the translationese measures and Section 4 the data and translation systems used in our study .
Section 5 presents our results , comparing human with machine translations and comparing MT architectures among themselves .
Section 6 concludes the paper .
Related Work Translationese seems to affect the semantic as well as the structural level of text , but much of its effects can be seen in syntax and grammar ( Santos , 1995 ; Puurtinen , 2003 ) .
An interesting aspect of translationese is that , while it is somewhat difficult to detect for the human eye ( Tirkkonen - Condit , 2002 ) , it can be machine learned with high accuracy ( Baroni and Bernardini , 2006 ; Rubino et al. , 2016 ) .
Many ways to automatically detect translationese have been devised , both with respect to textual translations and simultaneous interpreting ( Baroni and Bernardini , 2006 ; Ilisei et al. , 2010 ; Popescu , 2011 ) .
Simultaneous interpreting has shown specific forms of translationese distinct from those of textual translation ( He et al. , 2016 ; Shlesinger , 1995 ) , with a tendency of going in the direction of simplification and explicitation ( Gumul , 2006 ) .
Due to the particularly harsh constraints imposed on human interpreters , such particularities can be useful to better understand the nature and causes of translationese in general ( Shlesinger and Ordan , 2012 ) .
The features of machine translated text depend on the nature of both training and test data ; and possibly also on the approach to machine translation , i.e. statistical , neural or rule-based .
The best translation quality is achieved when the training parallel corpus is in the same direction as the test translation , i.e. original - to- translationese when one wants to translate originals ( Lembersky et al. , 2013 ) .
In this case , more human translationese features are expected , as systems tend to learn to reproduce human features .
The effects of translationese in machine translation test sets is also studied in Zhang and Toral ( 2019a ) .
In fact , texts displaying translationese features seems to be much easier to translate than originals , and recent studies advise to use only translations from original texts in order to ( automatically ) evaluate translation quality ( Graham et al. , 2019 ; Zhang and Toral , 2019 b ) .
By contrast , show a slight preference of human evaluators to outputs closer to originals ; in this case the translation is done from translationese input , because , as noted by Riley et al . ( 2019 ) , the best of the two worlds is not possible : one cannot create original - to-original corpora to train bias - free systems .
Aranberri ( 2020 ) analyzed translationese characteristics on translations obtained by five state - of- the- art Spanish - to - Basque translation systems , neural and rule-based .
The author quantifies translationese by measuring lexical variety , lexical density , length ratio and perplexity with part of speech ( PoS ) language models and finds no clear correlation with automatic translation quality across different test sets .
The results are not conclusive but translation quality seems not to correlate with translationese .
Similar results are obtained by Kunilovskaya and Lapshinova-Koltunski ( 2019 ) when using 45 morpho-syntactic features to analyze English -to - Russian translations .
Vanmassenhove et al. ( 2019 ) noted that statistical systems reproduce human lexical diversity better than neural systems , for English - Spanish and English - French even if transformer models , i.e. neural , are those with the highest BLEU score .
However , their transformer model did not use subword segmentation putting a limit on the plausible lexical diversity it can achieve .
In our study , we focus on English ( en ) and German ( de ) texts and compare the presence of translationese in human translations and interpreting , and in machine translations obtained by in- house MT engines .
Differently to Aranberri ( 2020 ) , we develop the MT engines to have control on the training data , since the aim of this work is not to study how translationese features correlate with translation quality , but the presence of translationese features themselves .
To measure them , we use two metrics : part-of-speech ( PoS ) perplexity and dependency parsing distances .
We use them as complementary measures , perplexity to model PoS sequences of linguistics objects in sentences ( linear dimension ) , and dependency distance to model their syntactic depth ( hierarchical dimension ) .
Translationese Measures
Part-of- Speech Perplexity
Our first measure to detect translationese is based on the assumption that a language model is able to capture the characteristic PoS sequences of a given language .
Since grammatical structures between languages differ , a language model trained on Universal Part of Speech sequences of English will on average display less perplexity if exposed to an English text than if exposed to a German text .
Following the same logic , if two models , one trained on English and one on German , were to progress through the PoS sequences of an English translation showing strong German interference , we could expect the English model 's perplexity scores to rise , while the German model 's perplexity would stay relatively low ( Toral , 2019 ) .
On the other hand , if the English translation were displaying normalisation , we would expect the English model to display a lower perplexity than the German one .
Perplexity is defined as the exponentiation of the entropy H ( p ) : 2 H( p ) = 2 ? x p( x ) log 2 p( x ) ( 1 ) where p( x ) is the probability of a token x ( possibly given its context ) , and ? log 2 p( x ) is the surprisal of x .
While surprisal measures in bits the uncertainty in a random variable taking a certain value x , entropy measures the weighted average surprisal of the variable .
Universal Dependencies
A syntactic analysis examines how the elements of a linguistic sequence relate to each other ; for our purposes , those elements are words of a sentence .
We employ the framework of Universal Dependencies ( UD ) , which expresses syntactic relations through dependencies : each element depends on another element , its head ( Nivre et al. , 2019 ) .
In UD , in contrast to most other dependency frameworks , the head is the semantically more salient element and the dependent modifies the head .
The top-level head is the root of a sequence , which is typically the main verb of the matrix clause .
For instance , in the sentence
The great sailor is waiving , the and great modify and depend on sailor , while sailor and is modify and depend on waiving , which is the root of the sentence .
Figure 1 illustrates a dependency analysis of this example .
The UD framework aims to be universal , i.e. suitable for all of the world 's languages , and there are a large number of resources and tools available .
1
An analysis of dependency lengths could help to identify translation artifacts .
If a source language is shining - through , the translation 's dependency lengths will be closer to the source language 's average ; and vice versa for normalisation .
Explicitation will lead to longer , and simplification to shorter distances compared to originals .
We use spaCy 's parser 2 to parse our corpora .
An evaluation of 2000 head tags taken from randomly sampled sentences gives an accuracy rate of 91.2 % and 93.6 % for the German spoken and written originals , respectively , and 95.0 % and 95.8 % for English , as evaluated by a senior linguist .
Sentences shorter than 3 tokens were excluded , as such sequences typically lack a verb and thus a root .
We then use those parses for a macro-analysis of the syntactic structures , viz .
an analysis of average summed distances .
This analysis measures for each word the distance in words to its head .
In Figure 1 , the distance from the to its head is 2 , from great to its head , it is 1 .
The sum of distances for the example is 6 .
In the following , we average the summed distances per sentence length .
The measure can be interpreted as a proxy of ( cumulative ) processing difficulty / complexity of a sequence , where long distance structures are regarded as more complex than structures with shorter distances .
Particle verbs illustrate this .
In Mary picked the guy that we met the other day up , the particle up has a long distance to its head and the sequence is relatively hard to process .
This contrasts to Mary picked up the guy that we met the other day , where the distance between particle and verb is short , which reduces the cognitive load .
This dependency - based measure is taken from Gibson et al . ( 2019 ) and Futrell et al . ( 2015 ) and builds on work by Liu ( 2008 ) .
Experimental Settings
Corpora Originals and Human Translations .
We used human written texts and speech transcriptions to train and test our language models and to extract part of our syntactic distance measures .
We use datasets that belong to the same genre and register but to different modalities : transcriptions of European Parliament speeches by native speakers and their interpreted renditions ( EPIC - UdS , spoken ) , the written speeches and their official translations ( Europarl - UdS , written ) ( Karakanta et al. , 2018 ) .
Table 1 summarizes the number of sentences and words for each of the six categories :
1 . Original written English 2 . Original written German 3 . Original spoken English ( transcript ) 4 . Original spoken German ( transcript ) 5 . English to German translations 6 . English to German interpreting ( transcript )
For each corpus , we train the PoS models on 3000 random sentences and evaluate on the remaining data .
We tokenized our data using NLTK ( Bird and Loper , 2004 ) and performed universal PoS tagging via spaCy .
We train our language models using a one- layer LSTM with 50 units ( Chollet et al. , 2015 ) .
Due to the small dimensions of the vocabulary ( 17 PoS ) , 5 iterations over 3000 sentences suffice to converge .
In our experiments , we measure the average perplexity of each model on unseen human data from of each category , and on the translations produced by three MT architectures in two different settings ( see Section 4.2 ) .
MT Training Data .
In order to adapt our machine translation engines to the previous modalities as much as possible , we gather two different corpora from OPUS ( Tiedemann , 2012 ) , one of them text-oriented ( C t ) and the other speech-oriented ( C s ) .
The distribution of their sub-corpora is shown in Table 2 . Note that we do not include Europarl data here so that there is no overlap between MT training and our analysis data .
Note also that our speech data ( TED talks and subtitles ) is still made up from translations and not simultaneous interpreting .
This is important since it prevents MT systems from simply mimicking interpreting 's pronounced translationese .
All datasets are normalised , tokenized and truecased using standard Moses scripts ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) and cleaned for low quality pairs .
Duplicates are removed and sentences shorter than 4 tokens or with a length ratio greater than 9 are discarded .
We also eliminate sentence pairs which are not identified as English / German by langdetect 3 and apply basic cleaning procedures .
With this , we reduce the corpus size by more than half of the sentences .
In order to build balanced corpora we limit the number of sentences we used from ParaCrawl to 5 million and from Open Subtitles to 10 million .
With this , both C t and C s contain around 200 million tokens per language .
Finally , a byte-pair-encoding ( BPE ) ( Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) with 32 k merge operations trained jointly on ende data is applied before training neural systems .
After shuffling , 1,000 sentences are set aside for tuning / validation .
Machine Translation Engines
We train three different architectures , one statistical and two neural , on the corpora above .
Phrase - Based Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) .
SMT systems are trained using standard freely available software .
We estimate a 5 - gram language model using interpolated Kneser - Ney discounting with SRILM ( Stolcke , 2002 ) and both phrase extraction and decoding are done with the Moses package ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) .
The optimization of the feature weights of the model is done with Minimum Error Rate Training ( MERT ) ( Och , 2003 ) against the BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) evaluation metric .
As features , we use the language model , direct and inverse phrase probabilities , direct and inverse lexical probabilities , phrase and word penalties , and lexicalized reordering .
The neural systems are trained using the Marian toolkit ( Junczys - Dowmunt et al. , 2018 ) in a bidirectional setting {en , de} ? { de, en} :
RNN - Based Neural Machine Translation ( RNN ) .
The architecture consists of a 1 - layer bidirectional encoder with complex GRU units ( 4 layers ) and a decoder also with complex GRUs ( 8 layers ) .
The tied embeddings have a dimension of 512 and hidden states with a size of 1024 , using the Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with ? 1 =0.9 , ? 2 =0.98 and = 1e-09 and a growing learning rate from 0 to 0.0003 .
Label ( 0.1 ) and exponential smoothing , dropout of 0.1 and layer normalisation are also applied .
Transformer Base Neural Machine Translation ( TRF ) .
We use a base transformer architecture as defined in Vaswani et al . ( 2017 ) , that is , a 6 - layer encoder - decoder with 8 - head self-attention , a 2048 - dim hidden feed -forward , and 512 - dim word vectors .
Optimization algorithm , dropout , smoothings and learning rate ( with warmup till update 16,000 ) are the same as for RNN .
Experimental Results
Below we present the translationese characteristics in the different modalities found in our study .
Human Translationese
Perplexity
The PoS perplexity scores of our language models on human data shows that , as expected , each model 's perplexity is at its lowest when confronted with data from the same category .
Since the amount of data differs among modalities , we checked that 10 independent partitions of the data lead to the same results .
Translation and interpreting models are least perplexed by unseen instances of their own categories , and are not confused by original written or spoken data : translation and interpreting display indeed detectable and idiosyncratic patterns .
Figure 2 shows perplexity scores in a matrix where the x-axis reflects the data on which the language models have been trained , and the y-axis reflects the partition of data on which the PoS mod - els are tested .
The diagonal corresponds to training and testing in the same modality and language and , consequently , shows the lowest perplexities as said before .
Leaving the diagonal of the matrix aside , we see that German translations are least perplexing for the model trained on written German , and vice-versa , written German sequences are least perplexing for the model trained on German translation .
The German translation model displays its highest perplexity on English , and the written English model is more perplexed by German translations than by German originals .
These observations seem to point away from shining - through , and to point instead towards the presence of normalization in German translation and interpreting .
Interpreting differs from translation .
While German translation sequences are of low-perplexity for the written German model , German interpreting sequences are quite perplexing for the spoken German model , and in general present higher levels of perplexity than translation for all German models .
Unlike German translation , the interpreting model returns high perplexity on all datasets except its own .
This particularity of interpreting data was previously noted ( Bizzoni et al. , 2019 ) and ascribed to structural over-simplification , as a possible effect of the cognitive pressure on interpreters .
Syntax : Dependency Length
The corresponding analysis for our syntax measure is presented in Figure 3 , the top left and top center plots .
For written spoken data in both German and English , the summed dependency distances increase as sentence lengths increase , as one would expect .
Translations from English into German are slightly less complex than German originals .
The same applies to English - German interpreting .
This is in contrast with translations from German into English , that are somewhat more complex than the English originals .
For German-English interpreting , there is no difference to the originals .
Arguably , the fact that English -to - German translations are less complex than German originals and that German-to - English translations are more complex than English originals is an artifact of source language shining - through .
Notice that discrepancies between curves are more evident for long sentences , and that sentences in spoken texts are systematically shorter than in written text .
Human vs. Machine Translationese Effects of translationese are expected in MT outputs as long as the systems are trained with human data which is rich in translationese artifacts .
In this section , we compare the translationese effects present in human translations with those present in TRF translations , the state - of - the - art MT architecture .
For comparison , our bidirectional TRF trained with text-oriented data achieves a BLEU score of 35.5 into English and 38.1 into German on Newstest 2018 , and 33.0 and 36.2 respectively when trained with speech-oriented data .
MT systems have been trained using the corpora described in Table 2 . Data has not been classified according to translationese , but one can assume 4 that most of the corpora will be original English .
This would create a bias towards human-like translationese in German translations .
The single translationese feature that seems to be most characteristic of the output of our MT model is structural shining - through , a characteristic present in human translations , but that appears to become particularly relevant in various MT outputs , specially the ones translating German written modality into English .
Figure 4 shows low perplexities when the written German language model is used on the translated text into English ( 5.9 vs. 7.3 for the English model on the English translation ) .
According to the MT training data distribution , this feature cannot be due to data biases but to the MT architecture itself .
At the same time , Figure 3 : Averaged summed dependency distances , y-axis , per sentence length , x-axis , for German HTs ( top left ) and for English HTs ( top center ) .
The same incl .
HTs and MTs for translations of written English to German ( top right ) , spoken English to German ( bottom left ) , written German to English ( bottom center ) , and for spoken German to English ( bottom right ) .
target language normalisation , which is a prominent translationese feature in human translations , appears less evident in our MT output .
In this case , normalisation is only slightly more prominent in translations into German with a perplexity of 6.9 in translated text and 7.0 in translated speech , where translations into English score 7.3 and 6.9 respectively .
We also checked if the content of the MT training data is relevant for the conclusions and might bias the comparison with interpretings and translations for instance .
To this end , we use the text-oriented MT engine to translate speech , and the speech-oriented MT engine to translate text .
In our experiments , we reach equivalent perplexities for written text data whichever engine we use but , for speech , perplexities are in general higher when the text-oriented MT is used .
This could be expected , but we attribute the noticeable effect only on spoken data due to its completely different nature .
5 5 Whereas clean transcriptions as TED talks are used to train our speech-oriented engines , Europarl data include many speech- distinctive elements such as hesitations , broken sentences and repetitions : but / is / euh what / what 's most difficulty Possibly due to the larger presence of shiningthrough , machine translations from English to German appear to behave quite differently from machine translations from German to English .
While differences due to the source and target language naturally exist in human translations , the MT output appears more sensitive to such variations .
Summed parse tree distance Figure 3 show how TRF outputs are more complex than English originals and translations / interpretings but have a similar degree in the German counterparts .
We found that machine translation seems to over-correct translationese effects , again not following the characteristics of training data .
Translationese across MT Architectures
The previous section summarizes the differences between a state - of - the - art MT system and human translations / interpretings , but one could expect different behaviors for other architectures .
In the following , we present a detailed analysis of each arbringing in prisoners from Guant ?

chitecture for our two measures independently .
Perplexity
The results for PoS perplexities are illustrated in Figure 4 . Results on SMT .
German language models return on average higher perplexities on SMT than English models , and translations into English are on average less perplexing than translations into German , which hints at English to German shiningthrough .
The observed absence of shining - through in the human data confirms this hypothesis , since our German translation and interpreting models are highly perplexed by SMT data , indicating that this kind of translation presents structural patterns that differ from human translationese .
It also differs from neural systems in the sense that SMT seems to better reproduce the structure of the MT training corpus .
SMT is acknowledged to translate more literally , while NMT tends to be more inspirational , and this trend is observed in our setting too .
Results on RNN .
English models show higher perplexities when tested on any translated German than when tested on translated English , and German models show more perplexity for German translations than for English ones .
German translation and interpreting models reverse the pattern , showing lower perplexity on German translations than on English translations .
This seems to point to a more complex phenomenon , possibly a mix of shining - through and normalization , but it seems to be less perplexing for the models trained on translation and interpreting .
RNN 's translation patterns are clearly closer to human translationese than SMTs .
Results on TRF .
While RNN data attains the lowest average perplexity , our Transformer man-ages to attain the lowest single scores - reaching in some cases lower perplexities than the ones elicited by human equivalents .
Consistently , the highest TRF perplexities are lower than the highest perplexities of the other systems .
The single model displaying the lowest perplexity on this data is German Translation , followed by written German , while spoken German shows the highest perplexity , followed by German Interpreting .
Written German shows low-level perplexities on German translations , in accordance with the German translation model ; but also lower perplexities on English translations , which instead spark significant perplexities in the German translation model .
This behavior seems to point to a " stronger than human " shiningthrough of German into English , which makes English translations less surprising for German than for English but perplexes a model trained on the patterns of human translations .
Models trained on spoken data also appear more perplexed than models trained on written data , hinting at a presence of " written patterns " in speech translation that does not appear in human data .
Syntax : Dependency Length
The results for the syntactic macro-analysis of dependency lengths are illustrated in Figure 3 ( top right and all bottom plots ) .
Results on SMT .
Similarly to the trends observed with perplexities , the SMT translations diverge the most of all models .
Translations into German of English speech and text lack the complexity of the German originals and are even considerably less complex than human interpreting / translation .
Translations into English of German speech are also less complex than the HTs , in contrast to other models .
The model is only in line with human translations and other models when it comes to translations of German text .
Results on RNN .
Overall , RNN translations come out really well for this measure , meaning that they are able to mimic human outputs .
Translations of English texts into German are in line with German originals , translation of English speech is slightly more complex than the HTs .
Translations of German speech and texts into English are very close to the HTs .
Results on TRF .
The TRF translations of English texts into German come out really well , i.e. close to the HTs - the TRF comes closest of all models here .
Translations of English speech also comes close to the HTs .
However , TRF translations of German speech into English is overly complex in comparison to the HTs .
Translations of German texts are slightly more complex than the HTs .
Conclusions Crossing PoS perplexity scores and syntactic dependency lengths , we draw some conclusions about the difference between human and machine structural translationese in text and speech .
We summarize our findings as preliminary answers to the questions posed in the Introduction . Q1 .
The structural particularity displayed by human interpreting is not replicated by MT models : machine translation of spoken language is not as marked as human interpreting .
Human written translations are similar to comparable originals , while interpreting transcripts appear different from all other datasets , at least based on our measures .
This feature fails to appear in any of the machine translations .
If we look at MT models ' outputs going from SMT to TRF , we see that written language perplexity for the target decreases , without getting smaller than the human " lower bound " .
For spoken language , perplexity in MT seems to outdo human levels with ease : for example , TRF reaches 7.2 where human perplexity is 12 ( English to German Interpreting ) .
This apparent improvement on speech - based data could confirm the idea that the special features of interpreting depend on the cognitive overload of human translators rather than to a systematic difficulty of translating speech .
Q2 .
Overall , we see a decrease of perplexity and an increase in syntactic complexity when moving from SMT to RNN to TRF , hinting at a tendency for SMT to produce over-simplified structures , while neural systems seem able to deal better with the complexity of their source .
Figures 3 and 4 show these trends .
With respect to the syntactic measures , we see clear tendencies in the human translations .
The MTs , however , are more heterogeneous : translations by the SMT often over-simplify in contrast to the HTs , translations by the neural systems come out reasonably close to the HTs , i.e. close to originals , but they are sometimes more complex .
In general the statistical engines show more evident signs of syntactic simplification than both human and neural translations .
This can be the result of having a phrase - based translation ( SMT ) in contrast to sentence - based translations ( humans and neural systems ) .
The difference between architectures is less strong for the grammatical perplexities , where machine translation displays in general higher levels of structural shining - through than human translation , and lower levels of normalization , presenting more sensibility to the source language than human translation .
In general , while we find evident differences in translationese between human and machine translations of text and speech , our results are complex to analyze and it would be wise not to overinterpret our findings .
In future work , the impact of the difference in the amount of available data and languages involved for written and spoken texts should also be analysed .
Machine translations do present symptoms of structural translationese , but such symptoms only in part resemble those displayed by human translators and interpreters , and often follow independent patterns that we still have to understand in depth .
This understanding can help in improving machine translation itself with simple techniques such as reranking of translation options , or more complex ones such as guiding the decoder to follow the desired patterns or rewarding their presence .
For this , a complementary study on the correlation of translation quality with our translationese measures is needed .
