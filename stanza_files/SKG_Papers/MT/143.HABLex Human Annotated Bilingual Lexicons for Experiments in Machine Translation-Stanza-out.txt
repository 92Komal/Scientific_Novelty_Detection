HABLex : Human Annotated Bilingual Lexicons for Experiments in Machine Translation
abstract
Bilingual lexicons are valuable resources used by professional human translators .
While these resources can be easily incorporated in statistical machine translation , it is unclear how to best do so in the neural framework .
In this work , we present the HABLex dataset , designed to test methods for bilingual lexicon integration into neural machine translation .
Our data consists of humangenerated alignments of words and phrases in machine translation test sets in three language pairs ( Russian ?
English , Chinese?
English , and Korean ?
English ) , resulting in clean bilingual lexicons which are well matched to the reference .
We also present two simple baselines - constrained decoding and continued training - and an improvement to continued training to address overfitting .
Introduction Neural machine translation ( NMT ) is the current state - of- the- art .
In contrast with statistical machine translation ( SMT ; Koehn et al. , 2007 ) , where there are several established methods of incorporating external knowledge , 1 recent work is still examining how best to incorporate bilingual lexicons into NMT systems .
Bilingual lexicon integration is desirable in a number of scenarios : highly technical vocabulary ( which might be rare , or require translations of a domain-specific sense ) , lowerresource settings ( where bilingual lexicons might be a significant portion of the available parallel data ) , translation settings where a client requires particular terms to be used ( e.g. brand names ) , or for improving rare word translation .
At present , there is no standard dataset for benchmarking bilingual lexicon integration , making it difficult to compare methods .

We create and release 2 Human Annotated Bilingual Lexicons ( HABLex ) .
Our bilingual lexicons are ( 1 ) generated by bilingual experts to ensure high quality , ( 2 ) derived from the development and test references so the best-case-scenario impact on translation performance can be directly measured , ( 3 ) covering 3 language pairs , and ( 4 ) focused on challenging words .
We perform exploratory work on our development set , showing two representative baselines to compare incorporating the lexicon at training time ( continued training ) vs. at decoding time ( constrained decoding ) .
We examine the tradeoffs in terms of BLEU , recall , and speed .
We also present a novel application of Elastic Weight Consolidation ( EWC ; Kirkpatrick et al. , 2017 ; Thompson et al. , 2019 ) which significantly improves performance by preventing overfitting during continued training on the bilingual lexicon .
Related Work
We first review prior work on incorporation of bilingual lexicons into NMT and then discuss the datasets used and explain how our new dataset addresses some shortcomings .
Recent work on the incorporation of bilingual lexicons into NMT systems can be loosely clus-tered into two categories : incorporation at training time or during decoding .
These two general approaches have different performance characteristics : incorporation at training time may slow down training , but tends not to alter inference speed , while incorporation at inference time tends to significantly slow down decoding ( see subsection 4.3 ) , but without slowing down training .
Zhang and Zong ( 2016 ) and Fadaee et al . ( 2017 ) both propose using bilingual lexicons to create synthetic bitext to augment training data for NMT systems .
Arthur et al. ( 2016 ) use translation probabilities from a lexicon ( like SMT phrase tables ) in conjunction with NMT probabilities .
Kothur et al. ( 2018 ) perform fine - grained continued training adaptation on very small , documentspecific bilingual lexicons of novel words .

A popular inference-time approach is constrained decoding ( Anderson et al. , 2016 ; Hokamp and Liu , 2017 ; Hasler et al. , 2018 ; Post and Vilar , 2018 ) , which modifies beam search to require that user-specified words or phrases to be present in the output hypotheses .
Constrained decoding can be used to ensure that target entries from a bilingual lexicon be present in the MT output whenever their corresponding source entries are present in the input .
Constrained decoding with multiple target options ( e.g. when a source word can be translated into one of several target words ) is addressed in and Hasler et al . ( 2018 ) .

Datasets Used in Prior Studies
Prior work has used either human-generated general purpose bilingual lexicons not tailored to a test set ( Arthur et al. , 2016 ; Zhang and Zong , 2016 ) or automatic alignments ( Fadaee et al. , 2017 ; Hokamp and Liu , 2017 ; Hasler et al. , 2018 ; Kothur et al. , 2018 ) which likely contain errors ( especially on rare words ) .
There exist manually word-aligned parallel corpora for Japanese -English Wikipedia data ( Neubig , 2011 ) and for Chinese - English mixed - domain data ( Liu and Sun , 2015 ) , from which it would be possible to extract lexicons .
Most prior work experimented in a single language pair , 4 making it difficult to predict if a method will generalize .
Our work addresses these issues by providing a multi-language testbed for comparisons , focusing on a consistent and lexically - challenging domain .
HABLex Dataset
Our motivation is to allow straightforward evaluation of lexicon incorporation methods .
By building a reference-derived bilingual lexicon , we ensure that if a method successfully learns correct translations from the lexicon while maintaining overall system performance , BLEU will increase .
We annotate the existing parallel text with alignments for certain vocabulary items , allowing us to extract bilingual lexicons that are specific to the context in which the translation should appear .
This produces a cleaner and more well - tailored bilingual lexicon than would be found in most realworld scenarios .
However , it could also be used as a standardized starting point to produce a noisier lexicon that more closely mimics real-world lexicons ( e.g. by adding irrelevant entries or relevant morphological variants , lemmatizing entries , or subsampling ) .
At a high level , our lexicons are created by a twostep process : ( 1 ) identifying interesting words on the source side of the test and development sets , and ( 2 ) human annotators correcting or validating automatic alignments of the identified words .
Patent Domain & Languages
We chose the patent domain because it contains interesting technical terminology and because of the availability of the high-quality , multilingual World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) COPPA - V2 corpus ( Junczys - Dowmunt et al. , 2016 ) .
We build bilingual lexicons for three language pairs : Russian ?
English ( Ru?En ) , Korean ?
English ( Ko?En ) , and Chinese ?
English ( Zh?En ) .
We also release the development and test splits from which the annotations were produced .
Interesting Word Selection
We select interesting words ( from the source side of the data ) as follows : words that appear less than 5 times in WIPO data , words 5 times in general domain training data ( see section 4 ) , and words that appear less than 5 times in both .
5
These represent three types of words that may be challenging to translate : words that have only recently been learned , words that may have been forgotten during continued training , and generally rare words .
Human Annotations
Our bilingual annotators used the LDC Word Aligner tool ( Grimes , 2010 ) to annotate words of interest in context .
Table 1 shows example lexicon entries resulting from this annotation process .
In order to save annotator time and effort , we displayed highlighted automatic alignments 6 of each of the words of interest in their parallel sentence context ( similar to Grimes et al . ( 2012 ) ) .
The annotator confirms or corrects the automatic alignment , adding or removing source or target side words as needed to complete a valid alignment .
Since annotation is cumbersome with very long sentences , we omit sentences of length 100 or more tokens .
Filtering out numerical entries and phrases longer than 3 words 7 results in bilingual lexicons with sizes shown in Table 2 .
The data contains a small number of discontiguous alignments ; these are so infrequent as to have a negligible effect on BLEU score results .
5
We focus on 5 - count ( and rarer ) words because we expect them to be particularly challenging for MT , but given time and resources there is nothing to prevent the application of the annotation protocol to other terms .
6 For strong initial alignments , GIZA ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003 ) is trained on train , development , and test for all data described in section 4 as well as a TED talk corpus ( Cettolo et al. , 2012 ) .
7
While we want the dictionary to match the reference , we did not want to train on large phrases from the reference .
Baseline Experiments and Results
To build strong baseline systems , we first train models on general domain data .
As general domain data , we use the OpenSubtitles18 ( Lison et al. , 2018 ) corpora for both Ru?En and Ko?En. For Ru?En and Zh?En we also use the parallel portion of the WMT17 news translation task ( Bojar et al. , 2017 ) .
We then fine- tune these generaldomain models on WIPO training data ( Luong and Manning , 2015 ) , using the dev set for validation .
These domain- adapted models are then used as the initial systems for our lexicon incorporation experiments .
We build the systems in Sockeye ( Hieber et al. , 2017 ) , using a two -layer LSTM network with hidden unit size 512 .
We use an initial learning rate of 3e - 4 both for training the general domain model and adapting to WIPO .
We apply the Moses tokenizer ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) , lowercasing , and bytepair encoding ( BPE ; Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) with a vocabulary size of 30k .
BPE is trained on the general domain corpus only , then applied to all data .
Evaluation Metrics
We evaluate lexicon incorporation approaches using two main metrics : BLEU and recall .
For each annotated instance of a source-side lexical entry , we can check whether the system output contains the correct aligned target -side translation .
Recall is computed as the percentage of the time that the system produces the correct output , averaged over all annotations .
Note that this does not guarantee that the words are placed in a sensible location in the sentence , only that they appear .
We also consider training and decoding speed .
All of these factors help determine which approaches are best given a particular use case .
For example , if a user requires exact fidelity to a lexicon ( e.g. branding ) , they may care the most about recall ( while still ensuring that overall translation quality is still acceptable ) .
Continued Training on HABLex
We perform continued training ( CT ; Luong and Manning , 2015 ) - typically used for domain adaptation - on the bilingual lexicon data .
With bilingual lexicons approximately two orders of magnitude larger than those used successfully in Kothur et al . ( 2018 ) , we find that performance drops dramatically with standard CT .
To address this problem , we apply EWC ( Kirkpatrick et ( Thompson et al. , 2019 ) ; we apply it to retain the ability to translate full sentences while training on a bilingual lexicon .
We experimented with initial learning rates ( 0.001 , 0.00316 , 0.01 , 0.0316 , 0.1 ) , all using SGD for 300 epochs , and EWC weight decay values ( 1e - 1 , 1e - 2 , 1e -3 , 1e - 4 , 1e - 5 ) .
We chose a learning rate 0.1 because it allowed recall to ( at least approximately ) converge , and a weight decay value of 1e - 4 because it performed reasonably well on the dev sets for all 3 languages .
All results reported are for the final checkpoint .
Constrained Decoding
We employ dynamic beam allocation ( DBA ; Post and Vilar , 2018 ) ses into banks based on the number of translated constraints , and a fixed - size beam is dynamically allocated across the banks .
While DBA has a time complexity constant in the number of constraints , in practice we find it to be approximately an order of magnitude slower than regular decoding , primarily because Sockeye does not currently support batched DBA .
9
One limitation of DBA is that it only works on constraints that have only one translation .
In this work , we report oracle choice ( use the right sense for the specific test sentence ) as an upper bound on performance and random choice ( choose a random possible translation ) as another baseline .
Our dictionary may contain more than one possible translation for a given target word .
For example , we observe the following three English translations for the Russian word ? : rebar , reinforced , and reinforcement .
These translations are appropriate in different contexts and are not interchangeable , so the oracle always selects the translation that is appropriate for the given sentence ( according to its reference translation ) .
The random approach selects one of the translations uniformly at random ; if there is only one translation , random is identical to oracle .
Results & Discussion
Table 3 summarizes key exploratory results for the baseline , CT , and CD approaches on the development set .
Table 4 shows baseline and random CD benchmarks on the test set , which we otherwise reserve and release for future evaluation .
We confine the remainder of our discussion to the experiments we performed on the development set .
EWC noticeably improves BLEU performance as compared to standard CT , while also increasing recall .
( See Figure 1 for example performance as the model is trained on the bilingual lexicon and Table 3 for results on all three language pairs . )
CD outperforms CT in terms of both BLEU score and recall , at the expense of decoding speed .
Random CD nears oracle CD performance because most source-side entries have only one translation .
We would not necessarily expect such high random CD performance if the bilingual lexicon averaged more senses per source entry .
The use case for bilingual lexicon incorporation should also influence user decisions about what approaches to use .
If exact translations ( e.g. brand names or highly technical translations ) are of the utmost importance , a CD approach might be preferred even if it is slower .
In the case that a general lexicon has been provided but there is more flexibility in terminology , it may be better to perform CT , or perhaps even a combination of the two .
Conclusions Bilingual lexicons are important resources in translation , but it is not clear how to best incorporate them in NMT .
To address this challenge , we present the HABLex dataset , a multi-language , reference - derived development and test set that facilitates the evaluation of lexicon incorporation .
We compare two baselines , based on incorporation at training time or at decode time , in terms of BLEU , recall , and speed .
We also present a novel application of EWC to continued training which addresses lexicon overfitting .

Although this method involves adapting the model , it is done prior to translating each document , so we view it as a decoding -time modification .

The recall of the oracle method would be 100 % , if there were no out - of- vocabulary subwords in the bilingual lexicon .
Constrained decoding with DBA takes 3.1 seconds per sentence on average on a Tesla K80 GPU .
