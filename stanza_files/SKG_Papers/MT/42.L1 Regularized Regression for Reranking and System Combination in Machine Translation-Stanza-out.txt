L 1 Regularized Regression for Reranking and System Combination in Machine Translation
abstract
We use L 1 regularized transductive regression to learn mappings between source and target features of the training sets derived for each test sentence and use these mappings to rerank translation outputs .
We compare the effectiveness of L 1 regularization techniques for regression to learn mappings between features given in a sparse feature matrix .
The results show the effectiveness of using L 1 regularization versus L 2 used in ridge regression .
We show that regression mapping is effective in reranking translation outputs and in selecting the best system combinations with encouraging results on different language pairs .
Introduction Regression can be used to find mappings between the source and target feature sets derived from given parallel corpora .
Transduction learning uses a subset of the training examples that are closely related to the test set without using the model induced by the full training set .
In the context of SMT , we select a few training instances for each test instance to guide the translation process .
This also gives us a computational advantage when considering the high dimensionality of the problem .
The goal in transductive regression based machine translation ( TRegMT ) is both reducing the computational burden of the regression approach by reducing the dimensionality of the training set and the feature set and also improving the translation quality by using transduction .
Transductive regression is shown to achieve higher accuracy than L 2 regularized ridge regression on some machine learning benchmark datasets ( Chapelle et al. , 1999 ) .
In an idealized feature mapping matrix where features are word sequences , we would like to observe few target features for each source feature derived from a source sentence .
In this setting , we can think of feature mappings being close to permutation matrices with one nonzero item for each column .
L 1 regularization helps us achieve solutions close to the permutation matrices by increasing sparsity .
We show that L 1 regularized regression mapping is effective in reranking translation outputs and present encouraging results on different language pairs in the translation task of WMT10 .
In the system combination task , different translation outputs of different translation systems are combined to find a better translation .
We model system combination task as a reranking problem among the competing translation models and present encouraging results with the TRegMT system .
Related Work : Regression techniques can be used to model the relationship between strings ( Cortes et al. , 2007 ) .
Wang et al. ( 2007 ) applies a string - to-string mapping approach to machine translation by using ordinary least squares regression and n-gram string kernels to a small dataset .
Later they use L 2 regularized least squares regression ( Wang and Shawe-Taylor , 2008 ) .
Although the translation quality they achieve is not better than Moses ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) , which is accepted to be the state - of - the - art , they show the feasibility of the approach .

An Overview of Regression Based Machine Translation
Let X and Y correspond to the token sets used to represent source and target strings , then a training sample of m inputs can be represented as ( x 1 , y 1 ) , . . . , ( x m , y m ) ? X * ?
Y * , where ( x i , y i ) corresponds to a pair of source and target language token sequences .
Our goal is to find a mapping f : X * ?
Y * that can convert a given set of source tokens to a set of target tokens that share the same meaning in the target language .
Figure 1 depicts the mappings between different representations .
? X : X * Y * - ? R ? - F X F Y g ? X ? Y 6 ? ?1 Y f h X * ?
F X = R N X and ?
Y : Y * ?
F Y = R N Y map each string sequence to a point in high dimensional real number space where dim ( F X ) = N X and dim ( F Y ) = N Y . Let M X ? R N X ?m and M Y ? R N Y ?m such that M X = [?
X ( x 1 ) , . . . , ? X ( x m ) ] and M Y = [?
Y (y 1 ) , . . . , ? Y ( y m ) ] .
The ridge regression solution using L 2 regularization is found as : H L 2 = arg min H?R N Y ?N X M Y ?HM X 2 F +? H 2 F .( 1 ) Proposition 1 Solution to the cost function given in Equation 1 is found by the following identities : H = M Y M T X ( M X M T X + ?I N X ) ?1 ( primal ) H = M Y ( K X + ?I m ) ?1 M T X ( dual ) ( 2 ) where K X = M T X M X is the Gram matrix with K X ( i , j ) = k X ( x i , x j ) and k X ( x i , x j ) is the ker - nel function defined as k X ( x i , x j ) = ?( x i ) T ?( x j ) .
The primal solution involves the inversion of the covariance matrix in the feature space ( O( N 3 X ) ) and the dual solution involves the inversion of the kernel matrix in the instance space ( O ( m 3 ) ) and L 2 regularization term prevents the normal equations to be singular .
We use the dual solution when computing H L 2 .
Two main challenges of the RegMT approach are learning the regression function , g : X * ?
F Y , and solving the pre-image problem , which , given the features of the estimated target string sequence , g( x ) = ? Y ( ? ) , attempts to find y ?
Y * : f ( x ) = arg min y?Y * || g ( x ) ?
Y ( y ) || 2 . Pre-image calculation involves a search over possible translations minimizing the cost function : f ( x ) = arg min y?Y * ?Y ( y ) ? H?X ( x ) 2 = arg min y?Y * kY ( y , y ) ?

T ? R m?1 and K x X ?
R m?1 is defined similarly .
We use n-spectrum weighted word kernel ( Shawe - Taylor and Cristianini , 2004 ) as feature mappers which consider all word sequences up to order n : k( x , x ) = n X p=1 |x|?p+1 X i=1 |x |?p+1 X j=1 p I ( x [ i : i + p?1 ] = x [ j : j+p?1 ] ) ( 4 ) where x[ i : j] denotes a substring of x with the words in the range [ i , j ] , I ( . ) is the indicator function , and p is the number of words in the feature .
L 1 Regularized Regression
In statistical machine translation , parallel corpora , which contain translations of the same documents in source and target languages , are used to estimate a likely target translation for a given source sentence based on the observed translations .
String kernels lead to very sparse representations of the feature space and we examine the effectiveness of L 1 regularized regression to find the mappings between sparsely observed feature sets .
Sparsity in Translation Mappings
We would like to observe only a few nonzero target feature coefficients corresponding to a source feature in the coefficient matrix .
An example solution matrix representing a possible alignment between unigram source and target features could be the following : H e1 e2 e3 f1 1 1 f2 1 f3 1 Here e i represents unigram source features and f i represent unigram target features .
e 1 and e 3 have unambiguous translations whereas e 2 is ambiguous .
Even if unigram features lead to ambiguity , we expect higher order features like bigrams and trigrams to help us resolve the ambiguity .
Typical H matrices have thousands of features .
L 1 regularization helps us achieve solutions close to permutation matrices by increasing sparsity ( Bishop , 2006 ) .
In contrast , L 2 solutions give us dense matrices .
L 1 Regularized Regression for Learning H L 2 does not give us a sparse solution and most of the coefficients remain non-zero .
L 1 norm behaves both as a feature selection technique and a method for reducing coefficient values .
H L 1 = arg min H?R N Y ?N X M Y ? HM X 2 F +? H 1 .( 5 ) Equation 5 presents the lasso ( least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ) ( Tibshirani , 1996 ) solution where the regularization term is now the L 1 matrix norm defined as H 1 = i , j | H i , j |. Since L 1 regularization cost is not differentiable , H L 1 is found by optimization or approximation techniques .
We briefly describe three techniques to obtain L 1 regularized regression coefficients .
Forward Stagewise Regression ( FSR ) :
We experiment with forward stagewise regression ( FSR ) ( Hastie et al. , 2006 ) , which approximates the lasso .
The incremental forward stagewise regression algorithm increases the weight of the predictor variable that is most correlated with the residual by a small amount , , multiplied with the sign of the correlation at each step .
As ?
0 , the profile of the coefficients resemble the lasso ( Hastie et al. , 2009 ) . Quadratic Programming ( QP ) : We also use quadratic programming ( QP ) to find H L 1 .
We can pose lasso as a QP problem as follows ( M?rup and Clemmensen , 2007 ) .
We assume that the rows of M Y are independent and solve for each row i , M y i ?
R 1 ? m , using non-negative variables h + i , h ? i ?
R N X ?1 such that h i = h + i ? h ?
i : hi = arg min h My i ?
hMX 2 F +?
N X X k=1 |h k | , ( 6 ) hi = arg min hi 1 2 hi g MX g MX T hi T ? hi( g MX M T y i ? ?1 1 1 ) , ( 7 ) s.t. hi > 0 , g MX = ? MX ?MX - , hi = ?h+
i h ? i ?. Linear Programming ( LP ) : L 1 minimization can also be posed as a linear programming ( LP ) problem by interpreting the error term as the constraint ( Chen et al. , 1998 ) and solving for each row i : h i = arg min h h 1 subject to M y i = hM X , ( 8 ) which can again be solved using non-negative variables .
This is a slightly different optimization and the results can be different but linear programming solvers offer computational advantages .
Transductive Regression
Translation Experiments
We perform experiments on the translation task of the English -German , German-English , English - French , English -Spanish , and English - Czech language pairs using the training corpus provided in WMT10 .
Datasets and Baseline
We developed separate SMT models using Moses ( Koehn et al. , 2007 )
Feature mappers used are 3 - spectrum counting word kernels , which consider all N - grams up to order 3 weighted by the number of tokens in the feature .
We segment sentences using some of the punctuation for managing the feature set better and do not consider N - grams that cross segments .
We use BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2001 ) and NIST ( Doddington , 2002 ) evaluation metrics for measuring the performance of translations automatically .
Instance Selection Proper selection of training instances plays an important role to learn feature mappings with limited computational resources accurately .
In previous work ( Wang and Shawe-Taylor , 2008 ) , sentence based training instances were selected using tf -idf retrieval .
We transform test sentences to feature sets obtained by the kernel mapping before measuring their similarities and index the sentences based on the features .
Given a source sentence of length 20 , its feature representation would have a total of 57 uni / bi/tri-gram features .
If we select closest sentences from the training set , we may not have translations for all the features in this representation .
But if we search for translations of each feature , then we have a higher chance of covering all the features found in the sentence we are trying to translate .
The index acts as a dictionary of source phrases storing training set entries whose source sentence match the given source phrase .
The number of instances per feature is chosen inversely proportional to the frequency of the feature determined by the following formula : # instance ( f ) = n/ ln ( 1 + id fScore ( f )/9.0 ) , ( 9 ) where idfScore ( f ) sums the idf ( inverse document frequency ) of the tokens in feature f and n is a small number .
Addition of Brevity Penalty Detailed analysis of the results shows TRegMT score achieves better N - gram match percentages than Moses translation but suffers from the brevity penalty due to selecting shorter translations .
Due to using a cost function that minimizes the squared loss , TRegMT score tends to select shorter translations when the coverage is low .
We also observe that we are able to achieve higher scores for NIST , which suggests the addition of a brevity penalty to the score .
Precision based BLEU scoring divides N - gram match counts to N - gram counts found in the translation and this gives an advantage to shorter translations .
Therefore , a brevity penalty ( BP ) is added to penalize short translations : BP = min( 1 ? ref-length trans-length , 0 ) ( 10 ) BLEU = e ( log ( ngram prec ) + BP ) ( 11 ) where ngram prec represent the sum of n-gram precisions .
Moses rarely incurs BP as it has a word penalty parameter optimized against BLEU which penalizes translations that are too long or too short .
For instance , Moses 1 - best translation for en-de system achieves .1309 BLEU versus .1320 BLEU without BP .
We handle short translations in two ways .
We optimize the ? parameter of QP , which manages the sparsity of the solution ( larger ? values correspond to sparser solutions ) against BLEU score rather than the squared loss .
Optimization yields ? = 20.744 .
We alternatively add a BP cost to the squared loss : BP = e " min ( 1 ? |? Y ( y ) | | H? X ( x ) +? BP | ,0 ) " ( 12 ) f ( x ) = arg min y?Y * ?Y ( y ) ? H?X ( x ) 2 +?BP BP ( 13 ) where |.| denotes the length of the feature vector , . rounds feature weights to integers , ? BP is a constant weight added to the estimation , and ?
BP is the weight given for the BP cost .
| H? X ( x ) + ? BP | represents an estimate of the length of the reference as found by the TRegMT system .
This BP cost estimate is similar to the cost used in ( Serrano et al. , 2009 ) normalized by the length of the reference .
We found ? BP = 0.1316 and ? BP = ?13.68 when optimized on the en-de system .
We add a BP penalty to all of the reranking results given in the next section and QP results also use optimized ?.
( Riezler and Maxwell , 2005 ) with 1000 repetitions to determine score difference significance : results in bold are significant with p ? 0.01 and italic results with ( * ) are significant with p ? .05 .
The difference of the remaining from the baseline are not statistically significant .
Reranking Experiments
We rerank N - best lists by using linear combinations of the following scoring functions :
1 . TRegMT : Transductive regression based machine translation scores as found by Equation 3 .
2 . TM : Translation model scores we obtain from the baseline SMT system that is used to generate the N - best lists .
3 . LM : 5 - gram language model scores that the baseline SMT system uses when calculating the translation model scores .
The training set we obtain may not contain all of the features of the reference target due to low coverage .
Therefore , when performing reranking , we also add the cost coming from the features of ? Y ( y ) that are not represented in the training set to the squared loss as in : ? Y ( y ) \ F Y 2 + ? Y ( y ) ? H? X ( x ) 2 , ( 14 ) where ? Y ( y ) \ F Y represent the features of y not represented in the training set .
We note that TRegMT score only contains ordering information as present in the bi/tri-gram features in the training set .
Therefore , the addition of a 5 - gram LM score as well as the TM score , which also incorporates the LM score in itself , improves the performance .
We are not able to improve the BLEU score when we use TRegMT score by itself however we are able to achieve improvements in the NIST and 1 - WER scores .
The performance increase is important for two reasons .
First of all , we are able to improve the performance using blended spectrum 3 - gram features against translations obtained with 5 - gram language model and higher order features .
Outperforming higher order n-gram models is known to be a difficult task ( Galley and Manning , 2009 ) .
Secondly , increasing the performance with reranking itself is a hard task since possible translations are already constrained by the ones observed in Nbest lists .
Therefore , an increase in the N - best list size may increase the score gaps .
Table 2 presents reranking results on all of the language pairs we considered , using TRegMT , TM , and LM scores with the combination weights learned in the development set .
We are able to achieve better BLEU and NIST scores on all of the listed systems .
We are able to see up to .38 BLEU points increase for the en-es pair .
Oracle reranking performances are obtained by using BLEU scoring metric .
If we used only the TM and LM scores when reranking with the en-de system , then we would obtain .1309 BLEU and 5.1472 NIST scores .
We only see a minor increase in the NIST score and no change in the BLEU score with this setting when compared with the baseline given in Table 2 .
Due to computational reasons , we do not use the same number of instances to train different models .
In our experiments , we used n = 3 for L2 , n = 1.5 for FSR , and n = 1.2 for QP and LP solutions to select the number of instances in Equation 9 .
The average number of instances used per sentence in training corresponding to these choices are approximately 140 , 74 , and 61 .
Even with these decreased number of training instances , L 1 regularized regression techniques are able to achieve comparable scores to L 2 regularized regression model in Table 2 .
System Combination Experiments
We perform experiments on the system combination task for the English -German , German-English , English - French , English -Spanish , and English - Czech language pairs using the training corpus provided in WMT10 .
Datasets
We use the training set provided in WMT10 to index and select transductive instances from .
The challenge split the test set for the translation task of 2489 sentences into a tuning set of 455 sentences and a test set with the remaining 2034 sentences .
Translation outputs for each system is given in a separate file and the number of system outputs per translation pair varies .
We have tokenized and lowercased each of the system outputs and combined these in a single N - best file per language pair .
We also segment sentences using some of the punctuation for managing the feature set better .
We use these N - best lists for TRegMT reranking to select the best translation model .
Feature mappers used are 3 - spectrum counting word kernels , which consider all n-grams up to order 3 weighted by the number of tokens in the feature .
Experiments
We rerank N - best lists by using combinations of the following scoring functions :
1 . TRegMT : Transductive regression based machine translation scores as found by Equation 3 .
2 . TM ' : Translation model scores are obtained by measuring the average BLEU performance of each translation relative to the other translations in the N - best list .
3 . LM : We calculate 5 - gram language model scores for each translation using the language model trained over the target corpus provided in the translation task .
Since we do not have access to the reference translations nor to the translation model scores each system obtained for each sentence , we estimate translation model performance ( TM ' ) by measuring the average BLEU performance of each translation relative to the other translations in the N - best list .
Thus , each possible translation in the N - best list is BLEU scored against other translations and the average of these scores is selected as the TM score for the sentence .
Sentence level BLEU score calculation avoids singularities in ngram precisions by taking the maximum of the match count and 1 2|s i | for |s i | denoting the length of the source sentence s i as used in ( Macherey and Och , 2007 ) .
Table 3 presents reranking results on all of the language pairs we considered , using TRegMT , TM , and LM scores with the same combination weights as above .
Random model score lists the random model performance selected among the competing translations randomly and it is used as a baseline .
Best model score lists the performance of the best model performance .
We are able to achieve better BLEU and NIST scores in all of the listed systems except for the de-en language pair when compared with the performance of the best competing translation system .
The lower performance in the de-en language pair may be due to having a single best translation system that outperforms others significantly .
The difference between the best model performance and the mean as well as the variance of the scores in the de-en language pair is about twice their counterparts in en-de language pair .
Due to computational reasons , we do not use the same number of instances to train different models .
In our experiments , we used n = 4 for L2 , n = 1.5 for FSR , and n = 1.2 for QP and LP solutions to select the number of instances in Equation 9 .
The average number of instances used per sentence in training corresponding to these choices are approximately 189 , 78 , and 64 .
