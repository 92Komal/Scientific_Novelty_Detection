Syntax - based Statistical Machine Translation using Tree Automata and Tree Transducers
abstract
In this paper I present a Master 's thesis proposal in syntax - based Statistical Machine Translation .
I propose to build discriminative SMT models using both tree-to-string and tree - to - tree approaches .
Translation and language models will be represented mainly through the use of Tree Automata and Tree Transducers .
These formalisms have important representational properties that makes them well - suited for syntax modeling .
I also present an experiment plan to evaluate these models through the use of a parallel corpus written in English and Brazilian Portuguese .
Introduction Statistical Machine Translation ( SMT ) has dominated Machine Translation ( MT ) research in the last two decades .
One of its variants , Phrase - based SMT ( PB - SMT ) , is currently considered the state of the art in the area .
However , since the advent of PB - SMT by Koehn et al . ( 2003 ) and Och and Ney ( 2004 ) , purely statistical MT systems have not achieved considerable improvements .
So , new research directions point toward the use of linguistic resources integrated into SMT systems .
According to Lopez ( 2008 ) , there are four steps when building an SMT system : translational equivalence modeling 1 , parameterization , parameter estimation and decoding .
This Master 's thesis proposal aims to improve SMT systems by including syntactic information in the first and second steps .
There - fore , I plan to investigate two approaches : the Treeto-String ( TTS ) and the Tree-to- Tree ( TTT ) models .
In the former , syntactic information is provided only for the source language while in the latter , it is provided for both source and target languages .
There are many formal theories to represent syntax in a language , like Context -free Grammars ( CFGs ) , Tree Substitution Grammars ( TSGs ) , Tree Adjoining Grammars ( TAGs ) and all its synchronous counterparts .
In this work , I represent each sentence as a constituent tree and use Tree Automata ( TAs ) and Tree Transducers ( TTs ) in the language and translation models .
Although this work is mainly language independent , proof-of-concept experiments will be executed on the English and Brazilian Portuguese ( en - ptBR ) language pair .
Previous research on factored translation for this pair ( using morphological information ) showed that it improved the results in terms of BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2001 ) and NIST ( Doddington , 2002 ) scores , as shown in Table 1 ( Caseli and Nunes , 2009 ) .
However , even factored translation models have limitations : many languages ( and Brazilian Portuguese is not an exception ) have relatively loose word order constraints and present longdistance agreements that cannot be efficiently represented by those models .
Such phenomena motivate the use of more powerful models that take syntactic information into account .
Related work Syntax - based approaches for SMT have been proposed in many ways .
Some apply the TTS model : Yamada and Knight ( 2001 ) 2006 ) also uses transducer rules but extract them from parse trees in target language instead ( the string - to- tree approach - STT ) .
Works that apply the TTT model include Gildea ( 2003 ) and Zhang et al . ( 2008 ) .
All those works also include methods and algorithms for efficient rule extraction since it 's unfeasible to extract all possible rules from a parsed corpus due to exponential cost .
There have been research efforts to combine syntax - based systems with phrase - based systems .
These works mainly try to incorporate non-syntatic phrases into a syntax - based model : while Liu et al. ( 2006 ) integrates bilingual phrase tables as separate TTS templates , Zhang et al . ( 2008 ) uses an algorithm to convert leaves in a parse tree to phrases before rule extraction .
Language models that take into account syntactic aspects have also been an active research subject .
While works like Post and Gildea ( 2009 ) and Vandeghinste ( 2009 ) focus solely on language modeling itself , Graham and van Genabith ( 2010 ) shows an experiment that incorporates a syntax - based model into an PB - SMT system .
Tree automata and tree transducers Tree Automata are similar to Finite-state Automata ( FSA ) , except they recognize trees instead of strings ( or sequences of words ) .
Formally , FSA can only represent Regular Languages and thus , cannot efficiently model several syntactic features , including long-distance agreement .
TA recognize the socalled Regular Tree Languages ( RTLs ) , which can represent Context-free Languages ( CFLs ) since a set of all syntactic trees of a CFL is an RTL ( Comon et al. , 2007 ) .
However , it is important to note that the reciprocal is not true : there are RTLs that cannot be modeled by a CFL because those cannot capture the inner structure of trees .
Figure 1 shows such an RTL , composed of two trees .
If we extract an CFG from this RTL it would have the recursive rule S ? SS , which would generate an infinite set of syntactic trees .
In other words , there is n't an CFG capable to generate only the syntactic trees contained in the RTL shown in Figure 1 .
This feature implies that RTLs have more representational power than CFLs .
As a Finite-state Transducer ( FST ) is an extension of an FSA that produces strings , a Tree Transducer is an extension of a TA that produces trees .
An FST is composed by an input RTL , an output RTL and a set of transformation rules .
Restrictions can be added to the rules , leading to many TT variations , each with its properties ( Graehl et al. , 2008 ) .
The variations studied in this work are the xT ( extended top-down , for TTT models ) and xTS ( extended top-down treeto-string , for TTS models ) .
Top-down ( T ) transducers processes input trees starting from its root and descending through its nodes until it reaches the leaves , in contrast to bottom - up transducers , which do the opposite .
Figure 2 shows a T rule , where uppercase letters ( NP ) represent symbols , lowercase letters ( q , r , s ) represent states and x1 and x2 are variables ( formal definitions can be found in Comon et al . ( 2007 ) ) .
Default top-down transducers must have only one symbol on the left - hand sides and thus cannot model some syntactic transformations ( like local reordering , for example ) without relying on copy and delete operations ( Maletti et al. , 2009 ) .
Extended topdown transducers allow multiple symbols on lefthand sides , making them more suited for syntax modeling .
This property is shown on Figure 3 ( adapted from Maletti et al . ( 2009 ) ) .
Tree- to-string transducers simply drop the tree structure on right - hand sides , which makes them adequate for translation models wihtout syntactic information in one of the languages .
Figure 4 shows an example of a xTS rule , applied for the en-ptBR pair .
SMT Model
The systems will be implemented using a discriminative , log-linear model ( Och and Ney , 2002 ) , using the language and translation models as feature functions .
Settings that uses more features besides those two models will also be built .
In particular , I will investigate settings that incorporate nonsyntactic phrases , using methods similar to Liu et al . ( 2006 ) and Zhang et al . ( 2008 )
The translation models will be weighted TTs ( Graehl et al. , 2008 ) , which add probabilities to the rules .
These probabilities will be learned by an EM algorithm similar to the one described in Graehl et al . ( 2008 ) .
Rule extraction for TTS will be similar to the GHKM algorithm described in Galley et al . ( 2004 ) but I also plan to investigate the approaches used by Liu et al . ( 2006 ) and Nguyen et al . ( 2008 ) .
For TTT rule extraction , I will use a method similar to the one described in Zhang et al . ( 2008 ) .
I also plan to use language models which takes into account syntactic properties .
Although most works in syntactic language models uses tree grammars like TSGs and TAGs , these can be simulated by TAs and TTs ( Shieber , 2004 ; Maletti , 2010 ) .
This property can help the systems implementation because it 's possible to unite language and translation modeling in one TT toolkit .
Methods
In this section , I present the experiments proposed in my thesis and the materials required , along with the metrics used for evaluation .
This work is planned to be done over a year .
Materials
To implement and evaluate the techniques described , a parallel corpus with syntactic annotation is required .
As the focus of this thesis is the English and Brazilian Portuguese language pair , I will use the PesquisaFAPESP corpus 2 in my experiments .
This corpus is composed of 646 scientific papers , originally written in Brazilian Portuguese and manually translated into English , resulting in about 17,000 parallel sentences .
As for syntactic annotation , I will use the Berkeley parser ( Petrov and Klein , 2007 ) English and the PALAVRAS parser ( Bick , 2000 ) for Brazilian Portuguese .
In addition to the corpora and parsers , the following tools will be used : ? GIZA ++ 3 ( Och and Ney , 2000 ) for lexical alignment ?
Tiburon 4 ( May and Knight , 2006 ) for transducer training in both TTS and TTT systems ?
Moses 5 ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) for decoding
Experiments and evaluation Initially the corpus will be parsed using the tools described in section 5.1 and divided into a training set and a test set .
For the TTS systems ( one for each translation direction ) , the training set will be lexically aligned using GIZA ++ and for the TTT system , its syntactic trees will be aligned using techniques similar to the ones proposed by Gildea ( 2003 ) and by Zhang et al . ( 2008 ) .
Both TTS and TTT systems will be implemented using Tiburon and Moses .
For evaluation , BLEU and NIST scores on the test set will be used .
The baseline will be the score for factored translation , shown in Table 1 .
