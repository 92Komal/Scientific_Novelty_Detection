Paraphrasing Revisited with Neural Machine Translation
abstract
Recognizing and generating paraphrases is an important component in many natural language processing applications .
A wellestablished technique for automatically extracting paraphrases leverages bilingual corpora to find meaning -equivalent phrases in a single language by " pivoting " over a shared translation in another language .
In this paper we revisit bilingual pivoting in the context of neural machine translation and present a paraphrasing model based purely on neural networks .
Our model represents paraphrases in a continuous space , estimates the degree of semantic relatedness between text segments of arbitrary length , or generates candidate paraphrases for any source input .
Experimental results across tasks and datasets show that neural paraphrases outperform those obtained with conventional phrase - based pivoting approaches .
Introduction
Paraphrasing can be broadly described as the task of using an alternative surface form to express the same semantic content ( Madnani and Dorr , 2010 ) .
Much of the appeal of paraphrasing stems from its potential application to a wider range of NLP problems .
Examples include query and pattern expansion ( Riezler et al. , 2007 ) , summarization ( Barzilay , 2003 ) , question answering ( Lin and Pantel , 2001 ) , semantic parsing ( Berant and Liang , 2014 ) , semantic role labeling ( Woodsend and Lapata , 2014 ) , and machine translation ( Callison - Burch et al. , 2006 ) .
Most of the recent literature has focused on the automatic extraction of paraphrases from various different types of corpora consisting of parallel , non-parallel , and comparable texts .
One of the most successful proposals uses bilingual parallel corpora to induce paraphrases based on techniques from phrase - based statistical machine translation ( SMT , Koehn et al . ( 2003 ) ) .
The intuition behind Bannard and Callison- Burch 's ( 2005 ) bilingual pivoting method is that two English strings e 1 and e 2 that translate to the same foreign string f can be assumed to have the same meaning .
The method then pivots over f to extract e 1 , e 2 as a pair of paraphrases .
Drawing inspiration from syntaxbased SMT , several subsequent efforts ( Callison - Burch , 2008 ; Ganitkevitch et al. , 2011 ) extended this technique to syntactic paraphrases leading to the creation of PPDB ( Ganitkevitch et al. , 2013 ; Ganitkevitch and Callison- Burch , 2014 ) , a largescale paraphrase database containing over a billion of paraphrase pairs in 23 different languages .
In this paper we revisit the bilingual pivoting approach from the perspective of neural machine translation , a new approach to machine translation based purely on neural networks ( Kalchbrenner and Blunsom , 2013 ; Bahdanau et al. , 2014 ; Sutskever et al. , 2014 ; Luong et al. , 2015 ) .
At its core , NMT uses a deep neural network trained end-to -end to maximize the conditional probability of a correct translation given a source sentence , using a bilingual corpus .
NMT models have obtained state - of - the art performance for several language pairs ( Jean et al. , 2015 b ; Luong et al. , 2015 ) , using only parallel data for training , and minimal linguistic information .
In this paper we show how the bilingual pivoting method can be ported to NMT and argue that it offers at least three advantages over conventional methods .
Firstly , our neural paraphrasing model learns continuous space representations for phrases and sentences ( aka embeddings ) that can be usefully incorporated in downstream tasks such as recognizing textual similarity and entailment .
Secondly , the proposed model is able to either score a pair of paraphrase candidates ( of arbitrary length ) and generate target paraphrases for a given source input .
Due to the architecture of NMT , generation takes advantage of wider context compared to phrase - based approaches : target paraphrases are predicted based on the meaning of the source input and all previously generated target words .
In the remainder of the paper , we introduce our paraphrase model and experimentally compare it to the phrase - based pivoting approach .
We evaluate the model 's paraphrasing capability both intrinsically in a paraphrase detection task ( i.e. , decide the degree of semantic similarity between two sentences ) and extrinsically in a generation task .
Across tasks and datasets our results show that neural paraphrases yield superior performance when assessed automatically and by humans .
Related Work
The literature on paraphrasing is vast with methods varying according to the type of paraphrase being induced ( lexical or structural ) , the type of data used ( e.g. , monolingual or parallel corpus ) , the underlying representation ( surface form or syntax trees ) , and the acquisition method itself .
For an overview of these issues we refer the interested reader to Madnani and Dorr ( 2010 ) .
We focus on bilingual pivoting methods and aspects of neural machine translation pertaining to our model .
We also discuss related work on paraphrastic embeddings .
Bilingual Pivoting Paraphrase extraction using bilingual parallel corpora was proposed by Bannard and Callison-Burch ( 2005 ) .
Their method first extracts a bilingual phrase table and then obtains English paraphrases by pivoting through foreign language phrases .
Paraphrases for a given phrase are ranked using a paraphrase probability defined in terms of the translation model probabilities P( f |e ) and P( e| f ) where f and e are the foreign and English strings , respectively .
Motivated by the wish to model sentential paraphrases , follow - up work focused on syntaxdriven techniques again within the bilingual pivoting framework .
Extensions include representing paraphrases via rules obtained from a synchronous context free grammar ( Ganitkevitch et al. , 2011 ; Madnani et al. , 2007 ) as well as labeling paraphrases with linguistic annotations such as CCG categories ( Callison - Burch , 2008 ) and partof-speech tags ( Zhao et al. , 2008 ) .
In contrast , our model is syntax - agnostic , paraphrases are represented on the surface level without knowledge of any underlying grammar .
We capture paraphrases at varying levels of granularity , words , phrases or sentences without having to explicitly create a phrase table .
Neural Machine Translation
There has been a surge of interest recently in repurposing sequence transduction neural network models for machine translation ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ) .
Central to this approach is an encoder-decoder architecture implemented by recurrent neural networks .
The encoder reads the source sequence into a list of continuous -space representations from which the decoder generates the target sequence .
An attention mechanism ( Bahdanau et al. , 2014 ) is used to generate the region of focus during decoding .
We employ NMT as the backbone of our paraphrasing model .
In its simplest form our model exploits a one- to- one NMT architecture : the source English sentence is translated into k candidate foreign sentences and then back - translated into English .
Inspired by multi-way machine translation which has shown performance gains over single - pair models ( Zoph and Knight , 2016 ; Dong et al. , 2015 ; Firat et al. , 2016a ) , we also explore an alternative pivoting technique which uses multiple languages rather than a single one .
Our model inherits advantages from NMT such as a small memory footprint and conceptually easy decoding ( implemented as beam search ) .
Beyond paraphrase generation , we experimentally show that the representations learned by our model are useful in semantic relatedness tasks .
Paraphrastic Embeddings
The successful use of word embeddings in various NLP tasks has provided further impetus to use paraphrases .
Wieting et al. ( 2015 ) take the paraphrases contained in PPDB and embed them into a low-dimensional space using a recursive neural network similar to Socher et al . ( 2013 ) .
In follow - up work ( Wieting et al. , 2016 ) , they learn sentence embeddings based on supervision provided by PPDB .
In our approach , embeddings are learned as part of the model and are available for any - length segments making use of no additional machinery beyond NMT itself .
Neural Paraphrasing
In this section we present PARANET , our Paraphrasing model based on Neural Machine Translation .
PARANET uses neural machine translation to first translate from English to a foreign pivot , which is then back - translated to English , producing a paraphrase .
In the following , we briefly overview the basic encoder-decoder NMT framework and then discuss how it can be extended to paraphrasing .
NMT Background
In the neural encoder-decoder framework for MT ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ; Bahdanau et al. , 2014 ; Luong et al. , 2015 ) , the encoder , a recurrent neural network ( RNN ) , is used to compress the meaning of the source sentence into a sequence of vectors .
The decoder , a conditional RNN language model , generates a target sentence word-by-word .
For the language pair , an encoder takes in a source sentence X = {x 1 , ... , x T X } , as a sequence of linguistic symbols and produces a sequence of context vectors C = {h 1 , ...h T X }. PARANET uses a bidirectional RNN , where each context vector h t is the concatenation of the forward and the backward RNN 's hidden states at time t.
The decoder is a conditional RNN language model that produces , given the source sentence , a probability distribution over the translation .
At each time step t , the decoder 's hidden state is updated : z t = RNN ( z t ?1 , y t ?1 , c t ) ( 1 )
The update uses the previous hidden state z t ?1 , the previous target symbol y t ?1 and the time dependent context c t , which is computed by an attention mechanism ?
t, t over the source sentences ' context vectors : c t = T x ? t=1 ? t , t h t ( 2 ) ? t , t ? e f ( z t ?1 , h t ) ( 3 ) g is a feedforward neural network with a softmax activation function in the output layer which returns the probability of the next target symbol .
The probability of the target sentence Y = {y 1 , ... , y T X } , is the product of the probabilities of the symbols within the sentence : P( Y | X ) = T Y ? t =1 P(y t |y <t , X ) ( 4 )
Pivoting Pivoting is often used in machine translation to overcome the shortage of parallel data , i , e. , when there is not a translation path from the source language to the target .
Instead , pivoting takes advantage of paths through an intermediate language .
The idea dates back at least to Kay ( 1997 ) , who observed that ambiguities in translating from one language onto another may be resolved if a translation into some third language is available , and has met with success in traditional phrase - based SMT ( Wu and Wang , 2007 ; Utiyama and Isahara , 2007 ) and more recently in neural MT systems ( Firat et al. , 2016 b ) .
In the case of paraphrasing , there is not a path from English to English .
Instead , a path from English to French to English can be used .
In other words , we translate a source sentence into a pivot language and then translate the pivot back into the source language .
Pivoting using NMT ensures that the entire sentence is considered when choosing a pivot .
The fact that contextual information is considered when translating , allows for a more accurate pivoted sentence .
It also places greater emphasis on capturing the meaning of the sentence , which is a key part of paraphrasing .
A naive approach to pivoting is one - to - one back - translation .
The source English sentence E 1 , is translated into a single French sentence F. Next , F is translated back into English , giving a probability distribution over English sentences , E 2 .
This translation distribution acts as the paraphrase distribution P( E 2 |E 1 , F ) : P( E 2 |E 1 , F ) = P( E 2 | F ) ( 5 ) One - to- one back - translating offers an easy way to paraphrase , because existing NMT systems can be used with no additional training or changes .
However , there are several disadvantages ; for example the French sentence F must fully capture the exact meaning of E 1 , as E 1 and E 2 are conditionally independent given F. Since there is rarely a clear one - to - one mapping between sentences in different languages , information about the source sentence can be lost , leading to inaccuracies in the paraphrase probabilities .
To avoid this , we propose back - translating through multiple sentences within one and multiple foreign languages .
Multi-pivoting PARANET pivots through the set of K-best translations F = { F 1 , ... F K } of E 1 .
This ensures that multiple aspects ( semantic and syntactic ) of the source sentence are captured .
Moreover , multiple pivots provide resilience against a single bad translation , which would prevent one - to - one back - translation from producing accurate paraphrase probabilities .
Translating from multiple pivot sentences into one target sentence requires that the decoder be redefined .
Firat et al. ( 2016 b ) propose several ways in which multiple pivot sentences can be incorporated into a NMT decoder .
We extended their late averaging approach to incorporate weights .
Consider the case of two pivot sentences from the same language , F 1 and F 2 . Each translation path individ -
After the EOL token is seen , decoding starts ( red circles ) .
At each time step the two decoders produce a probability distribution over all words , which are then combined ( in the yellow square ) using Equation ( 6 ) .
From this combined distribution a word is chosen , which is then given as input to each decoder .
ually computes the distribution over the target vocabulary P(y t = w|y <t , F 1 ) and P(y t = w|y <t , F 2 ) .
Our late-weighted combination approach defines the path with respect to both translations as : P(y t = w|y <t , F 1 , F 2 ) = ?
1 P(y t = w|y <t , F 1 ) +?
2 P(y t = w|y <t , F 2 ) While Firat et al. ( 2016 b ) train a new model to capture these joint translations , we leave the model unchanged , instead treating PARANET as a meta encoder-decoder model ( see Figure 1 ) .
Unlike late averaging , PARANET assigns weights ? to each pivot sentence .
These weights are set to the initial translation probabilities P( F i |E 1 ) , thus capturing the model 's confidence in the accuracy of the translation : P(y t =w|y <t , F 1 , F 2 ) = P( F 1 |E 1 ) P(y t =w|y < t , F 1 ) + P( F 2 |E 1 ) P(y t =w|y <t , F 2 ) Which can be trivially extended to include all translations from the K-best list : ( 6 ) P(y t = w|y <t , F ) = ? K i=1 P( F i |E 1 ) ? P(y t = w|y <t , F i )
To ensure a probability distribution , we normalize the K-best list F , such that the translation probabilities sum to one .
Multi-lingual Pivoting PARANET further expands on the multi pivot approach by pivoting not only over multiple sentences from one language , but also over multiple sentences from multiple languages .
Multi-lingual pivoting has been recently shown to improve translation quality ( Firat et al. , 2016 b ) , especially for low-resource language pairs .
Here , we hypothesize that it will also lead to more accurate paraphrases .
Multi-lingual pivoting requires a small extension to late-weighted combination .
We illustrate with German as a second language .
First , the source sentence is translated into a K-best list of French F Fr , and a K-best list of German F De .
Late-weighted combination is then applied , producing P(y t = w|y <t , F Fr ) and P(y t = w|y <t , F De ) .
These two output distributions are averaged , producing a multi-sentence , multilingual paraphrase probability : P(y t = w|y <t , F Fr , F De ) = 1 2 P(y t = w|y <t , F Fr ) + P(y t = w|y <t , F De ) which is used to obtain probability distributions over sentences : P( E 2 |E 1 ) = T E 2 ? t =1 P(y t |y <t , F Fr , F De ) ( 7 )
This can be trivially generalized to multiple languages .
In this paper we use up to three .
PARANET Applications
The applications of PARANET are many and varied .
We discuss some of these here and present detailed experimental evidence in Section 4 .
PARANET can be readily used for paraphrase detection ( the task of analyzing two text segments and determining if they have the same meaning ) , by computing Equation ( 7 ) .
In addition , it can identify which linguistic units are considered paraphrases and to what extent .
PARANET 's explanatory power stems from the attention mechanism inherent in the NMT systems .
In encoder- decoder models , attention is used during each step of decoding to indicate which are the relevant source words .
In our case , each word of the paraphrase attends to words within the pivot sentence and each word in the pivot sentence attends to words within the source sentence .
By summing out the weighted pivot sentence , it is possible to see the attention from paraphrase to Two men sailing in a small boat couple sailing in a tiny sail boat ?( E i 2 , E j 1 , F ) = F ? F P( E 2 |E 1 , F ) ?
T F ? m ( ?
E 2 , F i , m ? F,E 1 m , j ) ( 8 ) An example shown in Figure 2 where attention has successfully identified the semantically equivalent parts of two sentences .
Beyond providing interpretable paraphrasing , attention scores can be used as features in both generation and classification tasks .
Furthermore , PARANET can be readily used to perform text generation ( via the NMT decoder ) without additional resources or parameter estimation .
It also learns phrase and sentence embeddings for free without any model adjustments or recourse to resources like PPDB .
Experiments
We evaluated PARANET in several ways : ( a ) we examined whether the paraphrases learned by our model correlate with human judgments of paraphrase quality ; ( b ) we assessed PARANET in paraphrase and similarity detection tasks ; and ( c ) in a sentence - level paraphrase generation task .
We first present details on how PARANET and comparison models were trained and then discuss our results .
Neural Machine Translation Training
We used Groundhog 1 as the implementation of the NMT system for all experiments .
We generally followed the settings and training procedure from previous work ( Bahdanau et al. , 2014 ; Sennrich et al. , 2016 a ) .
As such , all networks have a hidden layer size of 1000 , and an embedding layer size of 620 .
During training , we used Adadelta ( Zeiler , 2012 ) , a minibatch size of 80 , and the training set was reshuffled between epochs .
We trained a network for approximately 7 days on a single GPU , then the embedding layer was fixed and training continued , as suggested in Jean et al . ( 2015 a ) , for 12 hours .
Additionally , the softmax was calculated over a filtered list of candidate translations .
Following Jean et al. ( 2015 a ) , we set the common 1 github.com / sebastien -j/LV groundhog vocabulary size as 10000 and 25 uni-gram translations , using a bilingual dictionary based on fastalign ( Dyer et al. , 2013 ) .
In our experiments , we used up to six encoder-decoder NMT models ( three pairs ) ; English ?
French , French ?
English , English ?
Czech , Czech ?
English , English ?
German , German ?
English .
All systems were trained on the available training data from the WMT15 shared translation task ( 4.2 million , 15.7 million , and 39 million sentence pairs for EN?DE , EN?CS , and EN? FR , respectively ) .
For EN ?DE and EN ?CS , we also had access to back - translated monolingual training data ( Sennrich et al. , 2016a ) , which we also used in training .
The data was pre-processed using standard pre-processing scripts found in MOSES ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) .
Rare words were split into sub-word units , following Sennrich et al . ( 2016 b ) .
BLEU scores for each NMT system can be seen in Table 1 .
Statistical Machine Translation Training
Throughout our experiments we compare PARANET against a paraphrase model trained with a commonly used Statistical Machine Translation system ( SMT ) , which we henceforth refer to as PARASTAT .
Specifically , for each language pair used , an equivalent IBM Model 4 phrase - based translation model was trained .
Additionally , an Operation Sequence Model ( OSM ) was included , which has been shown to improve the performance of SMT systems ( Durrani et al. , 2011 ) . SMT translation models were implemented using both GIZA ++ ( Och and Ney , 2003 ) and MOSES ( Koehn et al. , 2007 ) and were trained using the same pre-processed bilingual data provided to the NMT systems .
The SMT systems used a KenLM 5 - gram language model ( Heafield , 2011 ) , trained on the mono-lingual data from WMT 2015 .
For all languages pairs , both KenLM and MOSES were trained using the standard settings .
BLEU scores for the SMT systems are given in Table 1 .
Under the SMT models , paraphrase probabilities were calculated analogously to Equation ( 7 ) : and English to foreign ( E?F ) directions ) .
P( E 2 |E 1 , F ) = F ? F P( E 2 | F ) P ( F|E 1 ) ( 9
Correlation with Human Judgments
The PPDB 2.0 Human Evaluation data set is a sample of paraphrase pairs taken from PPDB which have been human annotated for semantic similarity ( Pavlick et al. , 2015 ) . 26,455 samples were taken from range of syntactic categories , resulting in paraphrase candidates varying from single words to multi-word expressions .
Each paraphrase pair was judged by five people on a 5 - point scale .
Ratings were then averaged giving each paraphrase pair a score between 1 and 5 .
Using this dataset we measure the correlation ( Spearman ? ) between ( length normalized ) PARANET probabilities ( Equation ( 7 ) ) assigned to paraphrase pairs and human judgments .
Figure 3 shows correlation coefficients for all language pairs using a single foreign pivot and 200 pivots .
Across all language combinations multiple pivots 2 achieve better correlations , with the German , Czech pair performing best with ? = 0.53 .
For comparison , Pavlick et al. ( 2015 ) report a correlation of ? = 0.41 using Equation ( 9 ) and PPDB ( Ganitkevitch et al. , 2013 ) .
The latter contains over 100 million paraphrases and was constructed over several English - to -foreign parallel corpora including Europarl v7 ( Koehn , 2005 ) which contains bitexts for the 19 European languages .
Following Pavlick et al. ( 2015 ) , we next developed a supervised scoring model .
Specifically , we fit a decision tree regressor on the PPDB 2.0 dataset using the implementation provided in scikit-learn ( Pedregosa et al. , 2011 ) .
To improve accuracy and control over-fitting we built an ensemble of regression trees using the Extra-Trees algorithm ( Geurts et al. , 2006 ) which fits a number of randomized decision trees ( a.k.a. extratrees ) on various sub-samples of the dataset .
In our experiments 1,000 trees were trained to minimize mean square error .
The regressor was trained with the following basic features : sentence length , 2 Across tasks and datasets we find that multiple pivots outperform single pivots .
We omit these comparisons from subsequent experiments for the sake of brevity .
pscore( E 2 , E 1 ) = P( E 2 |E 1 ) P(E 2 |E 1 ) + P( E 2 |E 2 ) ( 10 )
Two features reflect the alignment between candidate paraphrases .
We built an alignment matrix according to Equation ( 8 ) , and used the mean of the diagonal as feature .
This acts as a proxy of how much movement there is between two paraphrases .
The second feature is the number of unaligned words which we compute by calculating hard alignments between the two paraphrases .
Regressors varied with respect to how P( E 2 |E 1 ) was computed , keeping the string based features the same .
Equations ( 7 ) and ( 9 ) were used to calculate paraphrase probability for PARANET and PARASTAT , respectively .
For both models beam search ( with width set to 100 ) was used to generate the K-best list .
For each language , the K-best list is the union of the 100 - best list of E 1 and the 100 - best list of E 2 , giving a maximum of 200 pivot sentences .
As set out in Pavlick et al . ( 2015 ) evaluation is done using cross validation : in each fold , we hold out 200 phrases .
Table 2 presents results for PARANET and PARASTAT using different languages as pivots .
PARANET outperforms PARA - STAT across the board .
Furthermore , despite using fewer features and pivot languages , it obtains a closer correspondence to human data compared to PPDB 2.0 ( Pavlick et al. , 2015 ) .
Model
Paraphrase Identification and Similarity The SemEval - 2015 shared task on Paraphrase and Semantic Similarity In Twitter ( PIT ) uses a training and development set of 17,790 sentence pairs and a test set of 972 sentence pairs .
By design , the dataset contains colloquial sentences representing informal language usage and sentence pairs which are lexically similar but semantically dissimilar .
Sentence pairs were crawled from Twitter 's trending topics and associated tweets ( see Xu et al . ( 2014 ) for details ) .
The shared task consists of a ( binary ) paraphrase identification subtask ( i.e. , determine whether two sentences are paraphrases ) and an optional semantic similarity task ( i.e. , determine the similarity between two sentences on a scale of 1 - 5 , where 5 means completely equivalent and 1 not equivalent ) .
We trained a decision tree regressor on the PIT -2015 similarity dataset using the features described above .
Once trained , the decision tree regressor can be readily applied to the semantic similarity subtask .
For the paraphrase detection subtask , we use the same model and apply a threshold ( optimized on the validation set ) such that those pairs that are over this threshold are deemed paraphrases .
Tables 3 and 4 present our results on the two subtasks together with previously published results .
We evaluate system performance on the detection task using F1 ( the harmonic mean of precision and recall ) .
For semantic similarity , system outputs are compared by Pearson correlation against human scores .
The first block in the tables summarize results for PARANET and PARA - STAT using different languages as pivots .
The second block includes three baselines provided by the organizers of the shared task : a random baseline , a logistic regression baseline with minimal
Model PARASTAT ( Guo and Diab , 2012 ) .
The last two rows show the highest scoring systems : ASOBEK ( Eyecioglu and Keller , 2015 ) ranked 1st in the identification subtask and MITRE ( Zarrella et al. , 2015 ) in the similarity subtask .
Whereas ASOBEK uses knowledge- lean features based on word and character n-gram overlap , MITRE is a combination of multiple systems including mixtures of string matching metrics , alignments using tweet -specific word representations , and recurrent neural networks .
As can be seen , PARANET achieves better similarity and detection score than all baselines and PARASTAT , for any combinations of lan- guages .
This is particularly impressive as the translation models were trained on very dissimilar data .
Compared to the state of the art , PARANET fares worse , however our model was not particularly optimized on the PIT - 2015 dataset which was merely used as a testbed for a fair comparison .
It is thus reasonable to assume that taking into account more elaborate features ( e.g. , based on character embeddings ) would improve performance .
The highest semantic similarity score is obtained with PARANET trained using German data .
The highest scoring paraphrase detection model was PARANET trained on French and Czech data .
Interestingly , using multiple pivot languages seems to offer small improvements in most cases .
The languages selected as pivots in our experiments were somewhat ad-hoc .
We expect to get more mileage if these are selected from the same language family or with more linguistic insight ( e.g. , morphologically rich vs. poor ) .
Model
Semantic Textual Similarity
In semantic textual similarity ( STS ) , systems rate the degree of semantic equivalence between two text snippets .
We present results on the Semeval - 2015 English subtask which contains sentences from a wide range of domains , including newswire headlines , image descriptions , and answers from Q&A websites .
The training / test sets consist of 11,250 and 3,000 sentence pairs , respectively .
Sentence pairs are rated on a 1 - 5 scale , with 5 indicating they are completely equivalent .
We used the decision tree regressor with the same features described in the previous section .
Again , we experimented with one , two , and three languages as pivots , and compared PARANET and PARASTAT directly .
Our results are summarized in Table 5 .
The third block in the table presents a simple cosine - based baseline provided by the organizers ( Tokencos ) and the top-performing system ( DLS@CU ) which uses PPDB paraphrases to identify semantically similar words and word2vec embeddings trained on approximately 2.8 billion tokens ( Sultan et al. , 2014 ) . PARANET outperforms PARASTAT on all languages and language combinations .
Both systems outperform the Semeval baseline but are worse compared to the top scoring system .
We see for PARANET Czech achieves the highest scores , this could be in part due to Czech non-strict word order , which allows paraphrases that are simple rearrangements not be penalized .
Paraphrase Generation Finally , we evaluated PARANET ( and PARAS - TAT ) in a paraphrase generation task .
We created sentential paraphrases for three ( parallel monolingual ) datasets representative of different domains and genres : ( a ) the Multiple-Translation Chinese ( MTC ) corpus ( Huang et al. , 2002 ) contains news stories from three sources of journalistic Mandarin Chinese text translated into English by 4 translation agencies ; we sampled 1,000 sentences for training and testing , respectively ( each source sentence had an average of 4 paraphrases ) ; ( b) the Jules Vernes Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea novel ( Leagues ) corpus ( Pang et al. , 2003 ) contains two English translations of the French novel ; we sampled 500 sentences for training / testing ( each source sentence had one paraphrase ) ; and ( c ) the Wikianswers corpus ( Fader et al. , 2013 ) which contains questions taken from the website 3 wiki answers ; we sampled 1,000 questions for training / testing ( each question has on average 21 paraphrases ) .
In order to select the best paraphrase candidate for a given input sentence , PARASTAT was optimized on the training set using Minimum Error Training ( MERT , Och and Ney ( 2003 ) ) .
MERT integrates automatic evaluation metrics such as BLEU into the training process to achieve optimal end-to - end performance .
Naively optimizing for BLEU , however , will result in a trivial paraphrasing system heavily biased towards producing identity " paraphrases " .
Sun and Zhou ( 2012 ) sentence and rewards those close to the target : iBLEU (s , r s , c ) = ?BLEU ( c , r s ) ? ( 1 ? ?) BLEU ( c , s ) where s , is the source sentence , r s , is the target and c is the candidate paraphrase .
( 1 ? ?) BLEU ( c , s ) , measures the originality of the candidate paraphrase , BLEU ( c , r s ) measures semantic adequacy , and ? is a tuning parameter which balances the two .
Sentence level BLEU is calculated using plus one smoothing ( Lin and Och , 2004 ) .
PARANET relies on a relatively simple architecture which is trained end-to -end with the objective of maximizing the likelihood of the training data .
Since evaluation metrics cannot be straightforwardly integrated into this training procedure , we reranked the k-best paraphrases obtained from PARANET using a simple classifier which favors sentences which are dissimilar to the source .
Specifically , we trained a decision tree regression model with iBLEU as the target variable using the same features described in Section 4.4 .
Examples of paraphrases generated by PARANET are shown in the Appendix .
System output was assessed automatically using iBLEU with human-written paraphrases as reference .
In addition , we evaluated the generated text by eliciting human judgments via Amazon Mechanical Turk .
We randomly selected 100 source sentences from each data set and generated output with PARANET and PARASTAT ( using German as a pivot ) .
We also included a randomly selected human paraphrase as a goldstandard .
Workers ( self - reported native English speakers ) were asked to rank the three paraphrases from best to worst ( ties were allowed ) in order of semantic equivalence ( does the paraphrase convey the same meaning as the source ? ) and fluency ( is the description written in well - formed English ? ) .
Participants were explicitly told to give high ranks to output demonstrating a fair amount of paraphrasing and low ranks to trivial paraphrases ( e.g. , deletion of articles or punctuation ) .
We collected 5 responses per input sentence .
datasets .
For the sake of brevity , we only show results with one pivot language since combinations performed slightly worse for both models .
We set ? = 0.8 for iBLEU as we experimentally found it offers the best trade - off between semantic equivalence and dissimilarity .
As an upperbound we also measure iBLEU amongst the gold paraphrases provided by humans .
Again , we observe that PARANET has a slight advantage over PARASTAT in terms of iBLEU , however both systems tend to paraphrase less compared to the goldstandard .
Table 7 shows the mean ranks given to these systems by human subjects .
An Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) revealed a reliable effect of system type .
Post-hoc
Tukey tests showed that PARANET is significantly ( p < 0.01 ) better than PARASTAT across datasets ; PARANET is also significantly ( p < 0.01 ) better than the the gold standard on both MTC and the Wikianswers dataset .
We attribute this to the noisy nature of these two datasets which contain a wealth of paraphrases , a few of which are ungrammatical , contain typos or abbreviations leading to low scores among humans .
Conclusions
In this work we presented PARANET , a neural paraphrasing model based on bilingual pivoting .
Experimental results across several tasks ( similarity prediction , paraphrase identification , and paraphrase generation ) show that PARANET outperforms conventional paraphrasing methods .
In the future , we plan to exploit the attention scores more directly for extracting paraphrase pairs ( in analogy to PPDB ) and as features for classification tasks ( e.g. , textual entailment ) .
We would also like to investigate how PARANET can be adapted using reinforcement learning ( Ranzato et al. , 2016 ) to text generation tasks such as simplification and sentence compression .

Figure 1 : 1 Figure1 : Late-weighted combination : two pivot sentences are simultaneously translated to one target sentence .
Blue circles indicate the encoders , which individually encode the two source sentences .
After the EOL token is seen , decoding starts ( red circles ) .
At each time step the two decoders produce a probability distribution over all words , which are then combined ( in the yellow square ) using Equation ( 6 ) .
From this combined distribution a word is chosen , which is then given as input to each decoder .
