Mapping the PERFECT via Translation Mining
abstract
Semantic analyses of the PERFECT often defeat their own purpose : by restricting their attention to ' real ' perfects ( like the English one ) , they implicitly assume the PERFECT has predefined meanings and usages .
We turn the tables and focus on form , using data extracted from multilingual parallel corpora to automatically generate semantic maps ( Haspelmath , 1997 ) of the sequence ' HAVE / BE + past participle ' in five European languages ( German , English , Spanish , French , Dutch ) .
This technique , which we dub Translation Mining , has been applied before in the lexical domain ( W?lchli and Cysouw , 2012 ) but we showcase its application at the level of the grammar .
Introduction
The PERFECT is a diachronically and linguistically unstable category ( Lindstedt , 2000 ) and is subject to widespread cross-linguistic variation .
We zoom in on the HAVE PERFECT that Dahl and Velupillai ( 2013 ) trace back to a transitive possessive construction , and manifests itself mainly in Western European languages .
Despite extensive literature on the PERFECT , the goal of providing a proper semantics has not been reached ( Ritz , 2012 ) .
We propose to use semantic maps ( Haspelmath , 1997 ) for this purpose .
Semantic maps are geographical layouts that graphically represent how meanings of grammatical functions are related to each other .
While current formal semantic approaches to the PERFECT ( e.g. Portner ( 2003 ) ) are driven by sets of predefined usages exemplified by prototypical instantiations , we aim to generate semantic maps directly from data .
We believe multilingual parallel corpora are an excellent source for this .
Translation equivalents provide us with form variation across languages in contexts where the meaning is stable .
Parallel corpora have been frequently used in the domain of lexical semantics ( e.g. Dyvik ( 1998 ) ) .
We showcase a method ( adapted from W?lchli and Cysouw ( 2012 ) ) to create semantic maps directly from multilingual parallel corpora , and adapt it to the level of grammar .
We focus on a set of five European languages ( German , English , Spanish , French , Dutch ) , although the methodology can easily be adapted to include more languages .
Linguists commonly distinguish the three core PERFECT meanings in ( 1 ) : ( 1 ) a. Mary has visited Paris .
( her past visit is relevant now ) [ experiental ] b. Mary has moved to Paris .
( she currently lives in Paris ) [ resultative ] c. Mary has lived in Paris for five years ( now ) .
( she moved there five years ago ) [ continuative ]
The resultative meaning in ( 1 b ) is thought to constitute the core of the PERFECT .
However , ( 2 ) ( taken from the subtitles of " Body of Proof " ) shows that the same meaning of a past event and a result with current relevance can be conveyed by a PAST , PERFECT or PRESENT .
( 2 ) a .
In case you had n't noticed , we just got a confession .
[ en Taking ( 1 ) as a starting point for cross-linguistic variation , and ignoring other tense-aspect forms ( as in ( 2 ) ) would lead to a skewed view on variation and on the PERFECT itself .
As Ritz ( 2012 ) states , the PERFECT is the ' shapeshifter ' of tenseaspect categories , and adapts its meaning to fit into a given system .
Our final goal is to provide a compositional semantics of the PERFECT across languages that takes the variation in ( 2 ) and ( 2 ) into account .
The competing , form - based methodology that we outline in the next section constitutes the stepping stone that enables us to reach this goal .
Methodology
To construct semantic maps directly from data extracted from multilingual parallel corpora , we apply an existing method in the lexical domain ( W?lchli and Cysouw , 2012 ) at the level of grammar .
We dub our method Translation Mining .
In the following paragraphs , we lay out the method in detail .
Step 1 ) Extraction of PERFECTs
In the first phase , we extract fragments containing verbs phrases that match the ' HAVE / BE + past participle ' pattern from the EuroParl corpus ( Tiedemann , 2012 ) .
To do so , we modify an existing algorithm by van der Klis et al . ( 2015 ) , that takes care of three difficulties in extracting these forms from corpora : ( 1 ) words between the auxiliary verb and the past participle , ( 2 ) lexical restrictions for BE in French , German and Dutch and ( 3 ) a reversed order in subordinate clauses in German and Dutch .
The algorithm searches each of the five lan-guages under investigation ( German , English , Spanish , French and Dutch ) for PERFECTs and will then return the aligned sentences in the other languages .
This yields five-tuples of fragments consisting of at least one PERFECT .
Note that this approach is necessary to find the triplet in ( 2 ) , because only in German a PERFECT is involved .
This scheme therefore allows for competing forms within a language to enter the realm of investigation .
Also , taking five languages into account will create a broader perspective on the semantics of the PERFECT than monolingual research would do .

Step 2 ) Word- level alignment of verb phrases
After extracting fragments containing a PERFECT in step 1 , we asked a single human annotator ( a BSc student proficient in all languages under investigation ) to mark the corresponding verb phrases in the aligned fragments .
To facilitate the annotator 's job we created a web application ( dubbed TimeAlign ) that allows users to see two aligned fragments ( a " source " and a " translation " ) and to mark the corresponding verb phrase in the target language .

The annotator can also signal 1 The source code of this algorithm can be found on GitHub : https://github.com/UUDigitalHumanitieslab/ perfectextractor .

The application has been built in Django , a Python web framework ( https://www.djangoproject.com/).
Figure 1 : The annotation interface used in step 2 .
The annotator can select ( by clicking on words ) a suitable translation for the marked words in the source fragment , or use the checkboxes to mark the source as not being a PERFECT or as the translated fragment as an incorrect translation of the source fragment .
when the target fragment is not a correct translation of the source , or when the verb phrase in the source is in fact not a PERFECT ( see Figure 1 ) .
Fragments without a PERFECT in the source and incorrect translations are removed from the dataset .
The remaining pairs are merged back into five-tuples .
Step 2 thus yields five-tuples of verb phrases , at least one of which ( the source ) is a PERFECT .
Step 3 ) Tense attribution
In the third step , we assign tenses to the verb phrases marked in the translations ( see step 2 ) .
For the tense labelling , we opted for the categories displayed in Table 1 .
The tenses are automatically or manually assigned , depending on the level of detail of part- of-speech tags per language .
The tense attribution for English , French and Dutch is straightforward : we used the part- of-speech tagging of the EuroParl corpus to retrieve the label .
3 However , for German and Spanish we opt for manual tense attribution , because the part- of-speechtagging of the auxiliary verbs in EuroParl was too coarse-grained .
Step 4 ) Dissimilarity matrix
The tense attribution process of step 3 yields fivetuples of aligned tense attributions ( see an example outcome ) .
We design a simple distance function : we define five-tuples to be similar ( distance = 0 ) if all the tense attributions match up , if not , we add 1 for each mismatch and divide the sum by 5 .
We use the distance function on the five-tuples to create a ( dis ) similarity matrix .
Table 3 shows an application of the distance function and the resulting matrix .
We decided to remove five-tuples from the results in which one of the translations was missing or contained a non-verbal translation .
We believe including these examples in the current pilot study , with a limit dataset and only five languages in total , would have a negative effect on our analyses .
We will address this issue in future research .

The points are labelled using the tenses of the selected language .
Users can also change the dimensions shown .
Clicking on a point allows to inspect a single five-tuple ( example shown in Figure 3 ) .
Step 5 ) Visualization via multidimensional scaling
The resulting matrix from step 4 is then plotted using multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) 4 .
On top of that , we created an interactive visualization ( see Figure 2 ) .
This visualization shows which space the various tenses ( PERFECT and other ) occupy on the map , and thus enables researchers to see how tenses interact within a language .
The visualization also allows for comparison between languages , because it uses a color labeling that remains constant between languages ( e.g. the German Perfekt has the same color as the English present perfect ) .
Furthermore , being able to filter tenses allows to focus on one specific tense or interaction between specific tenses .
The researcher can also choose to show other dimensions of the MDS algorithm , which facilitates interpretation .
Hovering over a point on the map directly shows you the five-tuple the point is based on , and clicking on a point will yield a new page in which you can inspect the underlying data ( see Figure 3 for an example ) .
5 Compared to W?lchli and Cysouw ( 2012 ) , our main contributions in this methodology are ( 1 ) the web application to allow for easier annotation and ( 2 ) the interactive visualization of the MDS algo - 4 We use the MDS algorithm from the scikit-learn package ( Pedregosa et al. , 2011 ) , a Python package for machine learning , and visualized the results using the nvd3 package ( http://nvd3.org/).

rithm , which allows for researchers to more easily compare PERFECT usage within and across languages , as well as interpret dimensions .
Premilinary results
In this pilot study we analyzed a small part of the Q4/2000 portion of the EuroParl corpus .
6 Running the Translation Mining methodology on this corpus yielded 512 complete five-tuples in total .
We first observe the descriptive statistics in Table 4 that result from mapping the languagespecific tense labelling in step 3 to more generic tenses ( e.g. simple past to PAST , see Table 1 ) .
As is commonly reported in literature ( see de Swart ( 2007 ) and references therein ) , the French pass ?
compos ?
takes responsibility for a wide range of PERFECT uses .
In German and English one tends to use PAST for quite a few contexts where French would use the pass ?
compos ?.
In Spanish , the presente also competes with the PAST in this respect .
Figure 3 : Detailed view of a five-tuple of fragments .
The " source " fragment shows the extracted sentence from step 1 with the PERFECT marked in green .
The " translations " are the aligned fragments with manually annotated verb phrases from step 2 and semi-automatically annotated tenses from step 3 .
Moving from descriptive statistics to the MDS visualization , we look at dimensions governing the competition between languages .
The German data ( depicted in Figure 2 ) is most obvious in this respect , where the x-axis shows a transition from PERFECT to unmarked ( aspectual perspective ) , and the y-axis from PRESENT to PAST ( temporal orientation ) .
However , this attribution is not so easily translated into other languages , even though in each language we do find clear clusters of PERFECT use .
In the visualization , we can also look at outliers to find cases where one language is different from the other languages .
We can confirm e.g. that English requires a PAST with a locating time adverbial , whereas German , Dutch and French tolerate a PERFECT in this configuration .
Spanish patterns with English ( see Schaden ( 2009 ) ) in this respect .
An example of this phenomenon can be found in ( 3 ) below . ( 3 ) a. [ de ]
Frau Pr?sidentin , wir haben am 4 .
Dezember abgestimmt .
b. [ en ] Madam President , we voted on 4 December . c. [ es ] Se?ora Presidenta , votamos el pasado 4 de diciembre .
d. [ fr ]
Madame la Pr?sidente , nous avons vot ?
le 4 d?cembre . e. [ nl ]
Mevrouw de Voorzitter , op 4 december hebben wij hierover gestemd .
Another interesting outlier is the RECENT PAST , available for French and Spanish .
This periphrastic tense signals recency and is expressed in German , English and Dutch through the use of a PERFECT combined with an additional time adverbial : gerade , just , kortgeleden respectively , see ( 4 ) below .
A tentative conclusion could be that the RECENT PAST is a dimension of the PAST or of the PERFECT , but in both cases this recency requires additional marking .
Discussion
The interactive maps allowed us to reproduce earlier research ( e.g. de Swart ( 2007 ) , Schaden ( 2009 ) ) , but also to draw new conclusions on the tense / aspect role of the PERFECT across languages .
Our methodology can be applied to a wide range of grammatical phenomena .
There are some remaining issues though .
First of all , interpreting the results of the MDS algorithm is more qualitative than quantitative .
While the visualization helps researchers to form ideas on the role of the PERFECT , these intuitions will need to be supported by statistics .
We are currently looking into applying Analysis of Similarities ( ANOSIM , Clarke ( 1993 ) ) on the ( dis ) similarity matrices to pair this with the MDS visualization .
A second limitation is that the EuroParl corpus contains only political dialogue , and therefore might not cover the whole range of PER - FECT use .
We should also check for register variation .
Our plan is to repeat our methodology on the OpenSubtitles 2016 corpus ( Lison and Tiedemann , 2016 ) , as well as to find ( or create ) a multilingual parallel corpus of literary texts .
Lastly , we think the distance function we now use might be too simplistic .
It considers all tense differences to be equal , even though it is quite clear that e.g. a PRESENT is semantically more distant from a PAST PERFECT than a PERFECT .
Also , there is no cross-language comparison .
We plan to experiment with the distance function to finetune our results .
