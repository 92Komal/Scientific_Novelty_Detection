Non-Cooperation in Dialogue
abstract
This paper presents ongoing research on computational models for non-cooperative dialogue .
We start by analysing different levels of cooperation in conversation .
Then , inspired by findings from an empirical study , we propose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews .
Finally , we describe a research programme towards obtaining a suitable model and discuss previous accounts for conflictive dialogue , identifying the differences with our work .
Introduction
Most approaches to modeling conversation are based on a strong notion of cooperation between the dialogue participants ( DPs ) .
Traditional models using intentions ( Cohen and Levesque , 1991 ) , dialogue games ( Power , 1979 ) , shared plans ( Grosz and Sidner , 1990 ) or collaborative problem -solving ( Blaylock and Allen , 2005 ) explain dialogue situations in which DPs recognise each other 's intentions and , at least to a certain extent , accept each other 's goals when deciding on their actions .
These assumptions are theoretically grounded , as most work in linguistics has considered situations in which DPs share a common goal and cooperate to achieve it by means of conversation ( Grice , 1975 ; Clark and Schaefer , 1989 ) .
They are also practically sound : dialogue models are usually implemented in the form of dialogue systems , built for the purpose of providing a service to their users ( e.g. , TRAINS ( Allen and Schubert , 1991 ) ) .
In this scenario , failure to cooperate , either on the side of the system or of the user , is against the premises on which the system is conceived and used .
In everyday conversation , however , a great many situations escape the arguments above .
Con-sider the following example 1 : ( 1 ) PAXMAN [ 1 ] : ( interrupting )
Did you threaten to overrule him ?
HOWARD [ 2 ] :
I , I , was not entitled to instruct Derek Lewis , and I did not instruct him .
PAXMAN [ 3 ] :
Did you threaten to overrule him ?
HOWARD [ 4 ] :
The truth of the matter is that Mr. Marriott was not suspended .
I. . . PAXMAN [ 5 ]
We take it for granted that , at some level , Paxman and Howard are sharing a goal , for otherwise they would not be having an interview .
Still , the exchange is clearly conflictive , to the point that their behaviour compromises the flow of the conversation .
Heritage ( 1998 ) analyses the distinctive roles of DPs in news interviews : " the participants - IRs [ =interviewers ] and IEs [ =interviewees ] - exclude themselves from a wide variety of actions that they are normally free to do in the give and take of ordinary conversation .
If IRs restrict themselves to asking questions , then they cannot - at least overtly - express opinions , or argue with , debate or criticize the interviewees ' positions nor , conversely , agree with , support or defend them .
Correspondingly , if IEs restrict themselves to answers ( or responses ) to questions , then they cannot ask questions ( of IRs or other IEs ) , nor make unsolicited comments on previous remarks , initiate changes of topic , or divert the discussion into criticisms of the IR or the broadcasting organization . "
( Heritage , 1998 , p.8 )
Now , consider the fragment below 2 : ( 2 ) ( Newsnight , BBC , 2004 )
On this occasion , Howard provides an answer almost immediately and the flow of the conversation contrasts noticeably with that in ( 1 ) .
The investigation reported in this article aims at shedding light on the nature of non-cooperation in dialogue , by capturing the intuitions that allow us to differentiate between both conversations in terms of participant behaviour .
Dialogue games supporters could say that there is a game that describes the interaction in the first example .
While this might be true , such an approach would force us , in the limit , to define one game for each possible conversation that would not fit a certain standard .
Walton and Krabbe ( 1995 ) attempt a game - based approach in their study of natural argumentation .
They claim that a rigorous model of conversational interaction is useful , but accept that most of the huge variety of everyday conversation escapes it .
Dialogue games are based on strict rules that capture typical dialogue situations while leaving out considerable detail .
As example ( 1 ) shows , DPs behaviour can divert from the typical case in unexpected ways , falling outside the characterisation 3 . Nevertheless , the rules and patterns captured by game models are useful , as they describe the expected behaviour of the DPs under a certain conversational scenario .
In our research , we aim at reconciling two worlds , using the insights from dialogue games to provide a description of expected behaviour in the form of social obligations , but looking at naturally occurring cases that deviate from the norm .
This , in turn , calls for a technique to measure non-cooperation in dialogue and in this paper we provide one that is theoretically sound and supported by empirical evidence .
The following section discusses levels of cooperation in dialogue ; Section 3 presents an empirical study and a practical measure of noncooperation in political interviews ; in Section 4 we discuss related work , our working hypothesis and a methodology ; and Section 5 has the conclusions .
Linguistic and Non-Linguistic Cooperation Cooperation in dialogue can happen at different levels .
In most cases , conversation supports a social activity that constrains the behaviour acceptable or expected from the participants .
In addition , conversational behaviour determines how cooperatively participants engage in a social activity .
However , cooperation at the conversational level does not necessarily translate to the social level .
Consider , for instance , a witness under interrogation in a U.S. trial refusing to answer a question by appealing to the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution 4 . Such behaviour will be accepted in the conversational setting as established by law , although it is not cooperative in relation with the goals of the trial .
Non-cooperation at the conversational level , on the other hand , usually results in lack of cooperation at the social level .
Take as an example , the same witness remaining silent , rather than answering or appealing to the Fifth Amendment .
To illustrate further , consider a fictional alternative to ( 1 ) , where Howard replies by saying " I will not answer that question , as it is not relevant to whether I exceeded the powers of my office " .
This is not cooperative for the interview , but it is so at the linguistic level .
It would help in preserving the flow of the conversation , e.g. , by triggering a sub-dialogue to solve the disagreement .
The distinction between linguistic and nonlinguistic ( also called task - related , high - level or social ) cooperation has been addressed before .
Attardo ( 1997 ) revisits Gricean pragmatics , relating non-linguistic cooperation to participants ' behaviour towards realising task - related goals , and linguistic cooperation to assumptions on their respective behaviour in order to encode and decode intended meaning .
From a computational perspective , Bunt ( 1994 ) relies on a similar distinction for defining dialogue acts .
Also , Traum and Allen ( 1994 ) introduce discourse obligations as an alternative to joint intentions and shared plans , to allow for models of dialogues in which participants do not share the same high - level goals and where behaviour is also determined by " a sense of obligation to behave within limits set by the society " ( Traum and Allen , 1994 , p. 2 ) .
Walton and Krabbe ( 1995 ) proposed a typology of dialogue based on the initial situation triggering the exchange and participants ' shared aims and individual goals .
Based on their work , Reed and Long ( 1997 ) distinguish cases where participants follow a common set of dialogue rules and stay within a mutually acknowledged framework from a stronger notion in which their individual goals are in the same direction .
Borrowing from the latter , in the rest of the paper , we will speak of collaboration when DPs share the same task - level goals , and use cooperation when participants follow the conversational obligations imposed by the social activity ( i.e. , linguistic cooperation as discussed above ) .
We will not deal with collaboration here , though , as our focus is on non-cooperation .
An Empirical Study
In this section , we describe an empirical pilot study aimed at identifying a set of features that distinguish cooperative from non-cooperative conversational behaviour and at establishing a suitable domain in which to focus our work .
The Corpus
We collected the transcripts of 10 adversarial dialogues : 4 political interviews , 2 entertainment interviews , 1 parliamentary inquiry , 1 courtroom confrontation , 1 courtroom interrogation and 1 dispute .
The corpus includes 2 collaborative political interviews for result comparison and is nearly 14,500 words long 5 .
In a first analysis , we identified those surface features that characterised each conversation as conflictive : e.g. , interruptions , short turns , unfinished adjacency pairs , verbatim repetition .
Next , looking for a better understanding , we preformed an in- depth case study of one of the examples , approaching the analysis from different angles .
By studying , e.g. , the observance of turn- taking rules , the implicatures of the participants and , more extensively , how the case fitted within the normative framework proposed by Walton and Krabbe ( 1995 ) , we were able to better identify the nature of non-cooperative features present in the dialogue and establish a formalisable framework for approaching non-cooperative dialogue .
As for the domain , the wealth of interesting conversational situations that arise in political interviews make a suitable context for this research .
In the English-speaking world , journalists are wellknown for their incisive approach to public servants .
At the same time , politicians are usually well trained to deliver a set of key messages when speaking in public , and to avoid issues unfavorable to their image .
We will only consider naturally occurring ( i.e. non-scripted ) two -party interviews .
Degrees of Non-Cooperation Based on the analysis described above , we propose a technique for measuring non-cooperation in political interviews using a set of non-cooperative features ( NCFs ) .
The number of occurrences of these features will determine the degree of noncooperation ( DNC ) of an exchange .
We grouped NCFs following three aspects of conversation : turn-taking , grounding and speech acts ( see Table 1 for a complete list ) .
Turn-taking rules ( Sacks et al. , 1974 ) establish that speakers make their contributions at adequate places and in particular ways .
Interlocutors in a political interview are expected to respect transition - relevance places , openings and closings according to social conventions .
Failing to do so ( e.g. , by interrupting each other ) constitutes a noncooperative feature .
Grounding ( Clark and Schaefer , 1989 ) refers to participants ' acknowledgement of each other 's
Turn-Taking
For both speakers : ? interrupting ? overlapping ?
ending the exchange abruptly Grounding Interviewer fails to either : ? ask next relevant question ? move to next topical issue ? state irrelevance of answer Interviewee fails to either : ? give relevant answer ? reject question Speech Acts Interviewer either : ? expresses personal opinion ? argues , debates with or criticises interviewee 's position subjectively ?
agrees with , supports or defends interviewee 's position subjectively Interviewee either : ? asks ( non - CR ) question ( Searle , 1979 ) classifies utterances according to their associated force and propositional content .
Going back to Heritage 's comment , in a political interview participants can fail to restrict their speech acts to the force and content expected for their role .
Non-cooperative features related to speech acts include the interviewer expressing a personal opinion or criticising subjectively the interviewee 's positions and the interviewee asking questions ( except for clarification requests ) or making irrelevant comments .
? makes irrelevant comment ?
initiates change of topic ? criticises interviewer
We define the degree of non-cooperation ( DNC ) of a dialogue as the proportion of utterances with one of more occurrences of these non-cooperative features 6 . Furthermore , the DNC could be thus computed for the whole conversation and also for each participant , by counting only occurrences of features and utterances from each DP .
As an example , consider an extended fragment 6
At this stage , all NCFs are weighted equally .
This is a simplifying assumption we will remove in the future so that , e.g. , an interviewee attempting a change of topic has a stronger impact on the DNC than , say , one interrupting .
of ( 1 ) annotated with non-cooperative features ( O : overlap ; GF : grounding failure ; UC : unsolicited comment ; I : interruption ; TC : topic change ) : ( 3 ) The DNC was computed for all the political interviews in the corpus .
Table 3 shows the val-Table 3 : DNC of political interviews in the corpus ues obtained .
Adversarial interviews have a large number of NCFs , thus a high value for the DNC .
On the other hand , collaborative exchanges have low occurrence of NCFs ( or none at all ) 7 .
Discussion
There have been previous approaches to modeling dialogue on the basis that participants are not always fully cooperative .
Jameson ( 1989 ) presents an extensive study for modeling bias , individual goals , projected image and belief ascription in conversation .
User-model approaches are flexible to account for intricate situations but , as noted by Taylor et al . ( 1996 ) , can lead to problems like infinite regress in nested beliefs .
Taylor ( 1994 ) addressed non-cooperative dialogue behaviour by implementing CYNIC , a dialogue system able to generate and recognise deception ; a notion of noncooperation weaker than the one we address .
More recently , Traum ( 2008 ) brought attention to the need for computational accounts of dialogue situations in which a broader notion of cooperation is not assumed : e.g. , intelligent tutoring systems , bargaining agents , role-playing training 7
These results and the validity of DNC measure need further evaluation .
We are currently performing two studies : one to determine inter-annotator agreement of the coding scheme for NCFs , and another to test how NCFs correlate to human judgements of non-cooperative conversational behaviour .
agents 8 . Traum 's work on conflictive dialogue is mainly aimed at creating virtual humans with abilities to engage in adversarial dialogue .
Traum et al. ( 2008 ) present a model of conversation strategies for negotiation , that includes variables representing trust , politeness and emotions , and a set of conversational strategies .
Despite being adversarial in nature , the conversational scenarios are modeled by means of rules , that are followed by the interlocutors , according to the values of some of the variables .
Hence , the dialogues are adversarial , but cooperative under our characterisation of linguistic non-cooperation , and it is not clear how effectively the model accounts for cases in which participants fail to follow the rules of a scenario .
Working Hypothesis
Finding a suitable model of non-cooperative dialogue involves bridging the gap between the theoretical aspects mentioned so far and the evidence in the empirical data of the previous section .
Following Traum and Allen ( 1994 ) , we base on the hypothesis that non-cooperative features result from decisions that participants make during the conversation , by considering the obligations imposed by the social activity and their individual goals , with an adequate configuration of the priorities for goals and obligations .
Thus , a participant with high priorities for individual goals might compromise the workings of a conversation by choosing contributions that go against the norms of the social activity .
On the other hand , participants with higher priorities associated with obligations will favour contributions consistent with the rules of the social activity .
Research Methodology
For the next steps of the project , we will construct a model based on the hypothesis and test it by means of simulation 9 .
The construction of the model is a formalization of the working hypothesis , including rules for political interviews , goals , obligations , priorities and a dialogue management component .
At the moment of writing , we are investigating the line of research on obligation - driven dialogue modeling , initiated by Traum and Allen ( 1994 ) and developed further by Poesio and Traum ( 1998 ) and Kreutel and Matheson ( 2003 ) .
For the simulation , DPs will be autonomous conversational agents with a cognitive state consisting of goals , a notion of their expected behaviour in a political interview , priorities , and some knowledge of the world .
We are currently implementing a prototype based on EDIS ( Matheson et al. , 2000 ) .
Conclusions
In this paper we presented an attempt to shed light on non-cooperation in dialogue by proposing a practical measure of the degree of linguistic noncooperation in political interviews and a methodology towards a suitable computational model .
Table 1 : 1 NCFs for political interviews contributions by providing evidence of under - standing ( e.g , continued attention , relevant next contribution ) .
In political interviews a question is acknowledged by rejecting it or by providing a di- rect answer .
Likewise , answers are acknowledged by rejecting their relevance , by asking a next rel- evant question or by moving on to a new topical issue .
Failing to provide sufficient evidence of un - derstanding is also a non-cooperative feature .

BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman questions former UK Home Secretary Michael Howard with respect to a meeting in 1995 between Howard and the head of the Prison Service , Derek Lewis , about the dismissal of the governor of Parkhurst Prison , John Marriott , due to repeated security failures .
The case was given considerable attention in the media , as a result of accusations by Lewis that Howard had instructed him , thus exceeding the powers of his office .
This exchange took place seven years after ( 1 ) , when public awareness of the 1995 affair had dissipated .
Consider , for instance , Giznburg 's QUD model ( Ginzburg , 1996 ) when applied to dialogue ( 1 ) , in which Howard repeatedly fails to either accept or reject Paxman 's question . 4
" No person shall ( . . . ) be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself " .

Traum also provides a list of " behaviours of interest " , along the lines of the NCFs we identified above : e.g. , unilateral topic shifts or topic maintenance , unhelpful criticism , withholding of information , lying , deception , antagonism .9
The use of simulation in dialogue modeling was pioneered by Power ( 1979 ) .
It suits our project better than alternatives ( e.g. , Wizard - of - Oz , dialogue systems ) , by making it easier to introduce modifications , do re-runs , and generate a large number of cases with different parameter settings .
