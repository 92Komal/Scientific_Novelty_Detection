Understanding Linguistic Accommodation in Code-Switched Human-Machine Dialogues
abstract
Code-switching is a ubiquitous phenomenon in multilingual communities .
Natural language technologies that wish to communicate like humans must therefore adaptively incorporate code-switching techniques when they are deployed in multilingual settings .
To this end , we propose a Hindi-English human-machine dialogue system that elicits code-switching conversations in a controlled setting .
It uses different code-switching agent strategies to understand how users respond and accommodate to the agent 's language choice .
Through this system , we collect and release a new dataset COMMONDOST , comprising of 439 humanmachine multilingual conversations .
We adapt pre-defined metrics to discover linguistic accommodation from users to agents .
Finally , we compare these dialogues with Spanish - English dialogues collected in a similar setting , and analyze the impact of linguistic and socio-cultural factors on code-switching patterns across the two language pairs .

Introduction
When interlocutors share more than one language , they nearly inevitably engage in codeswitching ( CS ) : shifting from one language to another ( Sankoff and Poplack , 1981 ; Muysken , 2000 ; Auer , 2013 ) .
Since most people in the world today are multilingual ( Grosjean and Li , 2013 ) , CS is a ubiquitous phenomenon in multilingual communities .
It goes beyond simple lexical borrowing to blending of languages at syntactic , grammatical and morphological levels ( Sitaram et al. , 2019 ) .
Code-switching has been studied in linguistics and sociolinguistics for decades ( Poplack , 1980 ; Gumperz , 1982 ; Milroy et al. , 1995 ; Auer , 1 The code and data is available at https://github.

2013 ; Gardner-Chloros and Weston , 2015 ) since it reveals various linguistic and socio-cultural behaviours ( Heller , 1982 ) .
However , NLP studies of written CS are limited to social media texts , rather than natural conversation , and tend to focus on single sentences , rather than be contextualized in a dialogue ( Rabinovich et al. , 2019 ) .
Advances in dialogue research ( Vinyals and Le , 2015 ; Zhang et al. , 2020 ; Serban et al. , 2016 ) have enabled conversational AI technologies for humanmachine interactions , like Alexa and Siri .
Although these technologies are pervasive , they still have limited abilities to accommodate to the user , and they do not account for the ubiquity of multilingual communication .
Due to the lack of code-switching abilities in existing language technologies , there has been limited work in studying linguistic accommodation in written CS dialogues .
With the ultimate goal to enable adaptive codeswitching dialogue agents , in this paper we study user accommodation , i.e. , entrainment ( Brennan and Clark , 1996 ) in CS human-machine dialogues .
Our exploratory analysis of user accommodation will facilitate better development of dialogue agents which can eventually accommodate to users in return .
To this end , we adopt a collaborative dialogue framework of Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) , which converses with Spanish -English ( Spanglish ) bilinguals .
To facilitate a more general analysis , we extend this framework to Hindi-English ( Hinglish ) , a language pair which is typologically distinct from Spanglish and is spoken by millions of people .
We begin by providing background on codeswitching ( ?2 ) and linguistic accommodation ( ? 3 )
We then introduce our generalized bilingual dialogue system ( ?4 ) .
In ?5 , we describe our experimental setup for Hinglish data collection and discuss the data statistics .
We later provide our exploratory analysis of language accommodation and other socio-linguistic factors affecting the CS patterns in the user utterances ( ?6 ) .
A case-study comparing code-switching distributions across Hinglish and Spanglish is presented in ?7 .
Finally , we discuss directions for future work in ?8 .
This paper 's contributions include : ( 1 ) the development of a bilingual collaborative dialogue system easily generalizable to a new CS language pair , ( 2 ) a new dataset , COMMONDOST , comprising of 439 Hindi-English human-machine conversations , ( 3 ) adaptation of accommodation metrics and a corresponding analysis of accommodation of language style and choice in CS dialogues , and ( 4 ) an exploratory study of linguistic and socio-cultural factors on users ' CS patterns across Spanglish and Hinglish .
Code-Switching Strategies
Given that CS is used in very nuanced ways , researchers have been studying how people codeswitch , examining the switch -points of languages syntactically ( Poplack , 1980 ; Solorio and Liu , 2008 ) , prosodically ( Fricke et al. , 2016 ) , lexically ( Kootstra , 2012 , pragmatically ( Begum et al. , 2016 ) , and so forth .
Many works have attempted to model code-switching text and speech from a statistical perspective ( Garg et al. , 2018 a , b) . Recent works and benchmarks such as Linguistic Codeswitching Evaluation ( LinCE ) ( Aguilar et al. , 2020 ) and GLUECoS ( Khanuja et al. , 2020 ) have provided a unified platform to evaluate CS data for various NLP tasks across various language pairs .
Our work is in line with these recent efforts to pro-vide NLP capabilities to users with diverse linguistic backgrounds .
We extend the human-machine CS dialogue system by Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) to a new language pair of Hindi-English .
In order to better understand the style and usage of languages in a code-switched utterance , we cluster and characterize these utterances by a set of predefined CS strategies .
Previous works have mainly identified two commonly used code-switching ( CS ) strategies : Insertional and Alternational , and these strategy distinctions are important in implementations of CS technology ( Muysken , 2000 ; Bullock et al. , 2018 ) . Insertional CS strategy involves one language to be the matrix language ( MatL ) with the other serving as the embedded language ( EmbL ) .
Words / phrases from EmbL are inserted in the sentence while maintaining the grammar and structure of MatL ( Myers - Scotton , 1993 ) .
On the other hand , Alternational CS strategy involves alternating between separate independent clauses of the languages , switching from one MatL to another .
In our work , we focus on the Hindi-English language pair .
We experiment with 4 CS strategies - ( 1 ) EN CS is also observed more often in informal and casual settings than formal ones ( Sitaram et al. , 2019 ) .
We test this hypothesis by inducing informality in the agent 's strategies .
Although recent works ( Madaan et al. , 2020 ) have introduced neural methods to induce informality , we deploy a simple way to moderate formality by adding discourse markers ( e.g. " so " , " well " ) at the beginning and ending of sentences .
These markers are independent of context and syntax ( Schiffrin , 1988 ) , and are often associated with informality ( Jucker , 2002 ) .
Thus , we define four more agent strategies by infusing informality ( + Informality ) in each of the previously described 4 CS strategies .
Measuring Accommodation in Dialogue Communication Accommodation
Theory posits that people adjust their behaviors or speech styles to their conversational partners ' ( Giles et al. , 1973 ) .
Linguistic accommodation has proven to reduce interpersonal distance ( Camilleri , 1996 ) and is correlated with dialogue success and engagement ( Nenkova et al. , 2008 ) .
Although well -studied in the monolingual dialogues ( Brennan and Clark , 1996 ; Niederhoffer and Pennebaker , 2002 ) , it is relatively new in the CS setting .
Soto et al. ( 2018 ) found rate of code-switching to be accommodated in human-human Spanish - English dialogues .
Choice of language when code-switching can also be adapted in dialogues ( Bawa et al. , 2018 ) .
Fricke et al. ( 2016 ) further discover that part- of-speech of a CS utterance may impact the following language choice .
Our work adds to this field by studying accommodation of language choice for lexical classes .
In terms of quantifying accommodation , we adapt a metric from Mizukami et al . ( 2016 ) to measure accommodation ( we refer it to as global accommodation ) .
Global accommodation extends the score proposed in Nenkova et al . ( 2008 ) by aggregating a speaker 's word usage across an entire dialogue and biases it relatively with other non-partners in the corpus .
For two partners a and b , we denote E a , b = ? w?V | P r a ( w ) ? P r b ( w ) | for a given word class V ( where P r ( w ) is the empirical probability of word w ) .
Denoting the set of non-partners for the speaker a by N a , we define ratio as ratio ( E ( a , b ) , E ( a , np ) ) = ? ? ? ? ? 1 E ( a , b ) > E ( a , np ) 0.5 E ( a , b ) = E ( a , np ) 0 E ( a , b ) < E ( a , np ) for all non-partners np ?
N a .
The global score for the speaker a is the average of ratio over all the non-partners .
The final global score for the dataset is the average of the scores over all the speakers in the dataset .
In context of human-machine conversations , we choose the set of non-partners for an agent to be the set of humans that did not interact with this agent .
Since this metric is defined primarily for lexical accommodation , we redefine different styles as a lexical class to adapt it for measuring stylistic accommodation .
Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. ( 2011 ) presented another interesting metric which measures accommodation locally across turns within a single dialogue .
For two partners a and b , we can formulate this metric as local ( a , b ) ( C ) = P r T C b | T C a ?
P r T C b where T a and T b denote the messages of a and b respectively .
Here , T b is the reply to T a .
T C b ( and T C a ) denote the prevalence of style C in T b ( and T a ) .
In essence , it attempts to measure an increase / decrese in the usage of a style C by b grounded on the usage of C by a .
In our setting of human-machine conversations , since the agent 's strategy is fixed , it 's not as interesting to use this metric for our analysis .
Thus , we focus our analysis only using global accommodation metric .
Bilingual Dialogue System
Our bilingual human-machine dialogue system mainly serves two important purposes : ( 1 ) collection of CS data and ( 2 ) experimentation of new agent strategies .
Previous work ( Ramanarayanan and Suendermann - Oeft , 2017 ) developed a rulebased CS dialogue system restricted to a fixed set of prompts .
Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) proposed a more flexible bilingual system for English - Spanish as an extension of a monolingual goal-oriented collaborative dialogue framework ( He et al. , 2017 ) , originally designed for the MUTUALFRIENDS task .
This task provides the two conversational partners A and B individually with a knowledge base ( KB ) of friends , out of which there is exactly one friend common in both KBs .
Each friend in the KB has several attributes such as hobby , location of work , etc .
The goal of the task is to collaboratively find this mutual friend by text conversations between the two partners - which can be human or machine .
The modifications made by Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) for extending this monolingual system to support bilingual Spanish - English dialogues were mainly in three components : ( 1 ) Bilingual Readability : Supporting instructions and KB available to the users in Spanish as well as English , ( 2 ) Bilingual Response Generation : Procuring parallel Spanish sentences using a Machine Translation ( MT ) system and applying rule- based transformations for generating code-switched Spanglish , ( 3 ) Bilingual Response Understanding : Translating code-switched Spanish - English to monolingual English ( using a MT system ) and passing it to the pre-existing response understanding system for English .
Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) 's modified Spanish - English dialogue system cannot be directly applied across other language pairs due to three key reasons : ( 1 )
The dialogue system relies on a robust CS MT system 2 which is more readily available for resourcerich languages like Spanish and English .
Such systems might not be accessible for languages like Tagalog and Swahili .
( 2 ) The linguistic rule- based adaptations for generation are simple in the case of Spanish - English as they are typologically closer .
On the contrary , linguistically diverse pairs like Telugu - English might need further adaptations due to differences in word order and morphology .
( 3 ) Spanish and English are written using the same script .
Many other language pairs within which CS is pervasive , like Hindi-English , are written in different scripts , and are typically romanized in the CS setting .
Lack of normalization and robust transliteration models pose challenges to multiple system components for such pairs .
In our work , we build a more generalized dialogue system to tackle the challenges stated above .
One highlight of this modified system is its simplicity , which helps in adapting to new language pairs easily .
We briefly discuss these challenges and our enhancements to various components for our Hindi-English dialogue system below .
Language Bias in KB
Due to social and cultural priors , certain domains and topics in the KB might not be equally represented in both languages .
In order to avoid biasing the language usage in the dialogue and promote code-switching , it is necessary to carefully choose equilingual domains .
In the case of Hinglish , we replace the domain of college majors , which is highly anglicized with respect to Hindi , with favourite fruit which is more equally represented in both languages .
Handling gender-markings
Third person pronouns and verb forms in Hindi are usually gendermarked ( eg. karta / karti [ he / she does ] , uska / uski [ his / her ] ) .
Since the Spanglish KB does not provide any information about the gender of friends , we consequently notice the dialogues using this system to be gender-skewed .
In the COMMON -AMIGOS Spanglish data ( Ahn et al. , 2020 ) , the ratio of masculine to feminine word usage was 3.9 ; whereas for Hinglish 3 , this gender-ratio is 27.7 .
We mitigate this by simply adding a new " gender " attribute to the KB and correspondingly , notice a drastic drop of the gender-ratio to 3.4 for Hinglish .
Dialogue Generation
The Spanglish dialogue system utilizes a MT system 4 to generate parallel Spanish - English sentences and leverages rulebased transformations ( specific to Spanish ) to gen - 3 Tested on a set of 65 pilot dialogues .

erate code-switched sentences .
For language - pairs written in a non-native script ( e.g. Hinglish written in English ) , there is a need of an additional transliteration model alongside a MT model for script-conversion .
This agglomeration of the models leads to a cascade of errors that results in a poor overall translation .
We circumvent this issue by building a simple phrase - based translation system .
Despite its simplicity , the translation performance of the system is qualitatively better owing to the closed domain nature of the task .
Furthermore , the rule- based transformations need appropriate modifications to accommodate the new language pair .
For Hinglish , we synthesize additional transformations to handle differences in word order and verb conjugations .
Natural Language Understanding ( NLU )
The Spanglish dialogue system relies on a robust MT system for converting CS user utterances to English and then exploits an English NLU component for entity extraction .
Procuring such MT systems 5 for other language - pairs is not feasible .
This issue is amplified for languages written in non-native script ( Hinglish ) due to lack of normalization in user sentences .
We overcome this challenge by building a simple dictionary - based NLU component which can directly understand and extract entities from CS Hinglish text .
Although it cannot handle complex inputs , this simple model still outperforms the translation - based NLU pipeline .
Data
We use the modified bilingual dialogue framework ( ?4 ) to collect romanized Hindi-English CS data for human-machine dialogues .
Here , we first describe this data collection process and later discuss statistics for the collected data .
Data Collection
The majority of our data ( 80 % ) was collected by crowdsourcing our task on the Amazon Mechanical Turk 6 ( AMT ) platform , while the other 20 % of the data was collected via participation from local Indian communities .
A pre-requisite audio- based question - answering test is used to ensure the proficiency of the participants to chat in Hinglish .
We limit three attempts per participant to boost diversity of the data .
In order to draw direct comparisons between the collected Hinglish and Spanglish data , we closely follow the task setup as in Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) .
The instructions for the task are provided in Hinglish .
We further use a post-task survey to gather sociolinguistic information about the participants .
More details about the data collection process are described in the Appendix .
Data Processing
Owing to the lack of normalization of romanized Hindi , data processing and analysis is a non-trivial task .
Further , due to paucity of CS data , there are fewer commercial systems available .
To circumvent this issue , we develop simple custom tools and describe them below .
Language ID ( LID ) Tagger
It is an important component to identify language usage ( Hindi / English ) by users in the dialogue data .
We build a dictionary - based tagger using pre-populated lists of most common English words .
We mark the remaining words with the Hindi LID 7 .
This simple model achieves an accuracy of 94.5 % on an unseen set of 84 human- annotated sentences .
The tagged data is further corrected by human annotators .
CS Strategy Classifier
We classify the user utterances into one of 7 strategies - 4 CS ( see ?2 ) , 2 monolingual ( Hindi and English ) , or Neither .
We 7 Ambiguous words are handled with separate rules .
develop a simple rule- based system utilizing the LIDs for detection of these strategies .
Although this system uses simple heuristics , it achieves an F1 score of 0.85 on an unseen set of 84 CS sentences .
Two independent human linguists achieve an average F1 score of 0.85 on this set , thus validating the performance of the classifier .
Data Statistics
We collect a total of 439 human-machine conversations ( we provide an example dialogue in Table 1 ) across a pool of 164 unique people , wherein close to 85 % participants attempted the task more than once .
The distributions of the data collected via AMT and the local community are nearly the same except for age 8 .
The self-reported survey further reveals that among unique users , 72 % were male , 91 % have a college degree , and 90 % originate from the Indian subcontinent .
Nearly 72 % of users speak an additional regional Indian language other than Hindi or English .
We present the general statistics of our COM -MONDOST data and compare it with the Spanglish COMMONAMIGOS dialogue dataset ( Ahn et al. , 2020 ) in Table 2 .
Although our absolute task success rate is not very high , we procure good quality code-switched dialogue data due to the agent 's engagement .
Notably , we observe longer chats ( 12.44 utterances per dialogue ) for unsuccessful dialogues compared to successful ones ( 8.17 ) .
We also observe that utterances in the Hinglish data are generally longer than that of their Spanglish counterparts .
In terms of vocabulary sizes , we observe that COMMONAMIGOS data has a smaller Spanish vocabulary size when compared to the Hindi vocabulary size in the COMMONDOST data .
Overall , there is more CS in Hinglish data compared to Spanglish data .
Hinglish
Analysis of Hinglish Conversations
We study the impact of each of the agent strategies ( 4 CS strategies and their informal counterparts ) on the user dialogues using various dialogue - and language -oriented dimensions , as shown in Table 3 .
We also introduce monolingual agent strategies ( HI mono and EN mono ) and a random CS strategy 9 as baselines for our analysis .
We procure roughly 40 dialogues for each agent strategy for a principled comparison across these metrics .
Code-switching and Task Success
Our data substantiates the prevalence of CS in the language pair of Hindi-English .
Although no explicit instructions were provided to exhibit codeswitching , 92 % of the dialogues and 47 % of the user utterances are code-switched ( Table 2 ) .
Furthermore , even when the agent converses com - 9
We randomly switch between languages at a phrase-level .
pletely in Hindi or English , we observe CS in nearly 30 % of the user utterances ( Table 3 ) .
Thus clearly , our dialogue system elicits code-switching .
In a goal-oriented framework like ours , task success is an essential metric to assess our agent ( Column 3 in Table 3 ) .
We observe that task success is significantly better when the agent uses a CS strategy ( 62 % ) compared to agent 's monolingual strategies ( 48 % ) .
Furthermore , when users were asked to rate the agent for how non-native the agent seemed ( 1 - 5 , 5 is most non-native ) , agents using CS strategies were rated 2.62 , which is much lower than 2.92 and 3.11 when agents used monolingual and random strategies respectively .
Thus , CS aids in better communication and engagement between the agent and the user as suggested in Camilleri ( 1996 ) , which eventually translates to better success rate .
Informality improves Dialogue Quality Infusion of informality in the agent 's CS strategies has two major observable effects on the user dialogue .
First , we observe an increased user utterance length ( column 5 in Table 3 ) , which is in contrast to the finding in Ahn et al . ( 2020 ) .
We attribute this to the users being less curt 10 as they find the informal agent is relatively more friendly .
The us-age of discourse markers per dialogue by the users increases from 1.87 to 2.44 when conversing with an informal agent compared to a formal one .
Second , we witness a higher CS and reduced English usage in the user utterances ( column 6 and 8 in Table 3 ) , similar to the finding in Spanglish ( Ahn et al. , 2020 ) .
Finally , when users were asked to rate the agent for how human - like it seemed , ( 1 - 5 , 5 is most human-like ) , informal agents were rated 3.99 , which is higher than 3.54 for an agent without informality .
We conclude that informality helps the agent be perceived as friendlier .
It induces longer and more code-switched user responses , improving the quality of the conversation .
Linguistic Accommodation in Dialogue
We focus our analysis of accommodation on the choice and style of language usage in the CS setting .
We utilize the global accommodation metric ( ?3 ) to quantify our learnings .
Stylistic Dimension Global score Lexical Items ( KB ) 0.790 - English 0.648 - Hindi 0.700
CS Strategies 0.665 Table 4 : Reporting the global accommodation metric for the word class of lexical items ( KB ) ( row 1 ) .
We further report the accommodation score for the choice of language for these items ( row 2 and 3 ) .
Finally we report the score for accommodation of CS strategies ( row 4 ) .
Divergence is indicated by 0 while 1 indicates convergence , and 0.5 is no accommodation .
Language choice for lexical items Lexical accommodation of a word class is a common and well - observed phenomenon in monolingual dialogues .
In the CS setting , we study an additional dimension of language choice for the word class .
For example , if the agent uses the English word for mentioning fruits in its utterance , will the user also use the English word for referring fruits in their utterance ?
We focus this analysis on the word class of all the lexical items in the knowledge base ( in Hindi and English ) .
First , we evaluate the overall language - independent score for the word class and then the language - dependent scores highlighting the accommodation of language choice for referring to the word class ( first three rows in Table 4 ) .
We notice a high accommodation score for the overall word class of lexical items , which is expected due to the nature of the task .
We further witness a positive accommodation score for the usage of both languages ( Hindi and English ) while referring to this word class .
This result is more motivating given there is an inherent user bias 11 to use Hindi words ( 60 % ) compared to English words ( 40 % ) while referring to lexical items in the dialogue .
Thus , we conclude that the agent 's language choice for lexical items positively influences the users ' language choice too .
Accommodation of CS Strategy In Table 3 , we observe higher CS in user utterances when the agent is code-switching ( 51 % ) compared to when the agent is conversing monolingually ( 30 % ) .
This elicits the global accommodation of the phenomenon of code-switching by the users .
Here , we focus on studying the accommodation of the style of CS between the user and the agent .
Using the rule- based CS strategy classifier ( ?5.2 ) , we cluster the user utterances into one of the seven strategies - 4 CS , 2 monolingual , or neither .
In Figure 2 , we present a confusion matrix to study the impact of each agent 's CS strategy 12 on the usage of the users ' strategy .
Each row in the matrix represents the normalized distribution 13 of the user 11 Calculated by comparing usage on the random baseline .
572 CS strategies for the given agent strategy .
The diagonal elements in the matrix represent the percentage when the user adopts the same strategy as the agent .
In any column of the matrix , we observe that these elements are the highest ( statistically significant with p < 0.05 ) .
This implies that the user 's usage of any given CS strategy increases significantly when the agent is using the same strategy .
Using the global accommodation metric to quantify this phenomenon ( last row of Table 4 ) , we observe a high positive accommodation score .
Based on these observations , we conclude that users synchronize their style of language use with the agent in a CS setting .
( Gujarati , Marathi , Punjabi , Odia and Bengali ) .
These two strategies indicate that such speakers are adopting Hindi as their MatL , or at least in the beginning ( which is opposite as observed for South Indian speakers ) .
This phenomenon can be attributed to a higher influence of English in the South Indian languages and correspondingly , Hindi in the North Indian languages as suggested in Baldridge ( 2002 ) .
Overall , we believe that other languages of proficiency , as a proxy for geographical region and cultural factors , largely impact the dialogue and CS patterns , and are understudied in general .
Studying such patterns in human-human dialogues ( eg. when a North Indian speaker converses with a South Indian speaker in a CS setting ) would reveal further various socio-cultural factors influencing code-switching .
To gain better insights into how linguistic and sociocultural factors influence code-switching patterns , we compare the distributions of the users ' usage of various CS strategies in Hinglish and Spanglish in Figure 3 .
We observe that EN ins ? ? ?HI and EN ins ? ? ?SP are the most dominant CS strategies in Hinglish and Spanglish respectively .
On the other hand , we notice a large difference in the usage of Alternational CS strategies in the language pairs .
For Spanglish , it accounts to roughly 40 % while it is merely 10 % for Hinglish .
As attributed by the Equivalence Constraint , CS points tend to occur only if a syntactic rule is not violated in either of the two languages being mixed ( Poplack , 1980 ) .
Given this requirement , a pair of languages that have differing word order could have more constraints on where switches can occur .
We hypothesize that Alternational CS may not work within a verb clause in Hindi as it is a verbfinal ( SOV ) language while English is verb-medial ( SVO ) .
Spanish is verb-medial like English , and their word order similarity may facilitate the use of Alternational CS .
Beyond structural differences , sociolinguistic factors may affect CS strategies of speakers .
Backus ( 1998 ) describes a gradient of strategy usage across generations of immigrants .
Earlier gen-erations of immigrants would progress from simple to complex insertions , and later generations would alternate the two languages , eventually using reverse insertion .
As the Spanglish dataset includes later generations of immigrants to the US , 90 % of Hinglish speakers are 1st generation .
This would highlight Hinglish speakers ' affinity towards insertion into the Hindi matrix language .
Additionally , the status of English in the US ( for Spanglish ) and English in India ( for Hinglish ) is different .
As found in ?6.4 , the status of English can vary within regions of India itself , and this can lead to varying uses of CS strategy .
Attitudes towards language use have been shown to affect code choice in bilingual speakers ( Redinger , 2010 ) .
It is likely that attitudes towards CS is not the same in the Spanglish and Hinglish populations , which can provide further variability in the speakers ' language choice .
Conclusion and Future Work
In our work , we proposed a generalized bilingual dialogue system and procured human-machine dialogue data ( COMMONDOST ) for the language pair of Hindi-English using this system .
Adaptation of this dialogue system for newer CS languages could promote collection of more bilingual dialogue data .
Analysis of the COMMONDOST conversations revealed how users positively adopt and accommodate the agent 's style of using language in a CS utterance .
We also studied how informality and cultural factors independently affect the users ' CS patterns .
This proves that our findings are extendable across two CS pairs of Hinglish and Spanglish ( Ahn et al. , 2020 ) .
Similar analysis can be done for new language pairs ( such as Arabic- English ) and datasets from different domains .
Another area of potential research would be to compare our findings of the CS patterns and accommodation with human-human CS conversations .
Finally , we discussed how linguistic and sociopolitical factors affect the distribution of users ' CS patterns across the language pairs of Hinglish and Spanglish .
Despite their dissimilarities , the similarities across these language pairs is encouraging , as it open avenues to learn about how code-switching functions cross-linguistically .
We pave the path for future research on comparisons of multiple CS language pairs .
