Spectral Analysis of Information Density in Dialogue Predicts Collaborative Task Performance
abstract
We propose a perspective on dialogue that focuses on relative information contributions of conversation partners as a key to successful communication .
We predict the success of collaborative task in English and Danish corpora of task - oriented dialogue .
Two features are extracted from the frequency domain representations of the lexical entropy series of each interlocutor , power spectrum overlap ( PSO ) and relative phase ( RP ) .
We find that PSO is a negative predictor of task success , while RP is a positive one .
An SVM with these features significantly improved on previous task success prediction models .
Our findings suggest that the strategic distribution of information density between interlocutors is relevant to task success .
Introduction
What factors affect whether information is conveyed effectively and reliably in conversations ?
Several theoretical frameworks have emerged that model dialogical behavior at different granularity levels .
Can we use them to measure communicative effectiveness ?
Grounding theory ( Clark and Brennan , 1991 ) models a successful communication as a process during which " common ground " ( i.e. , mutual knowledge , beliefs etc. ) is jointly built among interlocutors .
The interactive alignment model ( IAM ) ( Pickering and Garrod , 2004 ) proposes that the ultimate goal of dialogue is the alignment of interlocutors ' situational model , which is helped by alignment at all other lower representation levels ( e.g. , lexical , syntactic etc. ) , driven by the psychologically well - documented priming effects .
Recently , empirical studies have verified the explanatory powers of the above-mentioned theories , especially the IAM , utilizing dialogues recorded and transcribed from various collaborative tasks conducted in laboratory settings ( Reitter and Moore , 2007 ; Reitter and Moore , 2014 ; Fusaroli et al. , 2012 ; Fusaroli and Tyl?n , 2016 ) .
In those studies , the quality of communication is directly reflected in the collaborative performance of interlocutors , i.e. , how successful they are in accomplishing the task .
Although they do not come to fully agree on which theoretical accounts of dialogue ( e.g. , interactive alignment vs. interpersonal synergy ) provides better explanations ( see Section 2.1 for details ) , the majority of these studies have confirmed that the alignment of certain linguistic markers , lexical items , or syntactic rules between interlocutors correlates with task success .
What is missing from the picture , however , is the computational understanding of how strategies of interaction and the mix of information contributions to the conversation facilitate successful communication .
This is understandable because those higher level concepts do not directly map onto the atomic linguistic elements and thus are much more difficult to define and operationalize .
In the present study , we intend to explore this missing part of work by characterizing how the interaction between interlocutors in terms of their information contributions affects the quality of communication .
An information - based approach Recent work has already used information theory to study the dynamics of dialogue .
Xu and Reitter ( 2016 b ) observed that the amount of lexical information ( measured by entropy ) from interlocutors of different roles , converges within the span of topic episodes in natural spoken dialogue .
Anon ( 2017 ) interpret this converging pattern as a re-flection of the dynamic process in which the information contributed by two interlocutors fluctuates in a complementary way at the early stage , and gradually reaches an equilibrium status .
Xu and Reitter ( 2016 b ) also correlated this entropy converging pattern with the topic shift phenomenon that frequently occurs in natural conversation ( Ng and Bradac , 1993 ) , and proposed that it reflects the process of interlocutors building the common ground that is necessary for the ongoing topics of conversation .
Based on Xu and Reitter 's ( 2016 ) finding that entropy converging pattern repeatedly occurs within dialogue ( though not necessarily at strictly regular intervals ) , it is reasonable to expect that after applying some spectral analysis techniques ( time space to frequency space conversion ) to the entropy series of dialogue , the frequency space representations should demonstrate some patterns that are distinct from white noise , because the periodicity properties in time space are captured .
Furthermore , we expect that how the frequency representations of two interlocutors correlate provides some information about the higher level properties of dialogue , e.g. , the task performance etc .
The thought is intuitive :
If we imagine the entropy series from two interlocutors as two ideal sinusoidal signals s 1 and s 2 ( supposedly of different frequencies , f 1 and f 2 ) ( Figure 1 ) , then the observed converging pattern can be thought of as a segment from the full spans of the signals .
Then the frequency space properties , such as how close f 1 and f 2 are , and the phase difference ?
between them , will definitely affect the shape of the converging pattern ( solid lines in Figure 1 ) .
As Xu and Reitter ( 2016 b ) argues that the converging segment reflects the grounding process between interlocutors , it is reasonable to expect that the shape and length of this segment are reflective of how well interlocutors understand each other , and the overall collaborative performance as well .
Based on the above considerations , the goal of the present study is to explore how the frequency space representations of the entropy series of dialogue are correlated with the collaborative performance of task .
We first demonstrate that entropy series satisfy the prerequisites of spectral analysis techniques in Section 4 .
Then we use two frequency space statistics , power spectrum overlap ( PSO ) and relative phase ( RP ) , to predict task success .
The reasons of using these two specific in - 2 Related Work
The success of dialogue
The interactive - alignment model ( IAM ) ( Pickering and Garrod , 2004 ) stipulates that communication is successful to the extent that communicators " understand relevant aspects of the world in the same way as each other " ( Garrod and Pickering , 2009 ) .
Qualitative and quantitative studies ( Garrod and A. Anderson , 1987 ; Pickering and Garrod , 2006 ; Reitter and Moore , 2014 ) have revealed that the alignment of linguistic elements at different representation levels between interlocutors facilitates the success of task - oriented dialogues .
More recently , different theoretical accounts other than IAM , such as interpersonal synergy ( Fusaroli et al. , 2014 ) and complexity matching ( Abney et al. , 2014 ) have been proposed to explain the mechanism of successful dialogue from the perspective of dynamic systems .
Fusaroli and Tyl?n ( 2016 ) compare the approaches of interactive alignment and interpersonal synergy in terms of how well they predict the collective performance in a joint task .
They find that the synergy approach is a better predictor than the alignment approach .
Abney et al. ( 2014 ) differentiate the concepts of behavior matching and complexity matching in dyadic interaction .
They demonstrate the acoustic onset events in speech signals exhibit power law clustering across timescales , and the complexity matching in these power law functions is reflective of whether the conversation is affiliative or argumentative .
The perspective taken by the present study has some common places with Fusaroli and Tyl ?n ( 2016 ) and Abney et al . 's ( 2014 ) work : we view dialogue as an interaction of two dynamic systems .
The joint decision- making task used by Fusaroli and Tyl?n ( 2016 ) resulted in a small corpus of dialogue in Danish , which we will use for the present study .
Information density in natural language Information Theory ( Shannon , 1948 ) predicts that the optimal way to communicate is to send information at a constant rate , a.k.a. the principle of entropy rate constancy ( ERC ) .
The way humans use natural language to communicate also follows this principle : by computing the local per-word entropy of the sentence ( which , under the prediction of ERC , will increase with sentence position ) , ERC is confirmed in both written text ( Genzel and Charniak , 2002 ; Genzel and Charniak , 2003 ; Keller , 2004 ; Qian and Jaeger , 2011 ) and spoken dialogue ( Xu and Reitter , 2016 b ; Xu and Reitter , 2016 a ) .
The theory of uniform information density ( UID ) extends ERC to syntactic representations ( Jaeger , 2010 ) and beyond .
The information density in language , i.e. , the distribution of entropy ( predictability ) , reveal the discourse structure to some extent .
For example , entropy drops at the boundaries between topics ( Genzel and Charniak , 2003 ; Qian and Jaeger , 2011 ) , and increases within a topic episode in dialogue ( Xu and Reitter , 2016 b ) ( see Section 1.1 ) .
The entropy of microblog text reflects changes in contextual information ( e.g. , an unexpected event in a sports game ) ( Doyle and Frank , 2015 ) .
In sum , per-word entropy quantifies the amount of lexical information in natural language , and therefore fulfills the needs of modeling the information contribution from interlocutors .
Spectral analysis methodology Spectral analysis , also referred to as frequency domain analysis , is a pervasively used technique in physics , engineering , economics and social sciences .
The key idea of it is to decompose a complex signal in time space into simpler components in frequency space , using mathematical operations such as Fourier transform ( Bracewell , 1986 ) .
The application of spectral analysis in human language technology mainly focuses on processing the acoustic signals of human voice , and capturing the para-linguistics features relevant to certain tasks ( Schuller et al. , 2013 ) .
For example , Bitouk et al. ( 2010 ) find that utterance - level spectral features are useful for emotion recognition .
Gregory Jr and Gallagher ( 2002 ) demonstrate that spectral information beneath 0.5 k Hz can predict US president election outcomes .
However , we are not aware of the usage of spectral analysis in studying linguistic phenomena at higher representation levels than the acoustic level .
For our study , we are looking for some techniques that can capture the coupling between two signals at frequency space .
The nature of the signal ( whether it is language - related or not ) should not be the first concern from the perspective of methodology .
Therefore , studies outside the field of speech communication and linguistics could also be enlightening to our work .
After searching the literature , we find that the spectral analysis techniques that Oullier et al . ( 2002 ) and Oullier et al . ( 2008 ) use to study the physical and social functions of human body movement are useful to our research goal .
In Oullier et al . 's ( 2002 ) work , subjects stood in a moving room and were to track a target attached to the wall .
A frequency space statistics , power spectrum overlap ( PSO ) , was used to demonstrate the coupling between motion of the room and motion of the subject 's head .
Stronger coupling effect ( higher PSO ) was found in the tracking task than a no-tracking baseline .
PSO in nature quantifies how much the frequency space representations of two signals ( power spectrum density ) overlap .
It allows us to explore the frequency space coupling of two interlocutors ' entropy series in dialogue .
Similarly , Oullier et al. ( 2008 ) used the metrics of peak- to - peak relative phase ( RP ) and PSO to study the spontaneous synchrony in behavior that emerges between interactants as a result of information exchange .
The signals to be analyzed were the flexion-extension movement of index fingers of two subjects sitting in front of each other .
Both metrics showed different patterns when the participants see each other or not .
RP , in their work , measures the magnitude of delay between two signals , and it corresponds to the notion of ? in Section 1.1 .
Methods
Corpus data
Two corpora are examined in this study : the HCRC Map Task Corpus ( A. H. Anderson et al. , 1991 ) and a smaller corpus in Danish from a joint decision - making study ( Fusaroli et al. , 2012 ) , henceforth DJD .
Map
Task contains a set of 128 dialogues between two subjects , who accomplished a cooperative task together .
They were given two slightly different maps of imaginary landmarks .
One of them plays as the instruction giver , who has routes marked on her map , and the other plays as the instruction follower , who does not have routes .
The task for them is to reproduce the giver 's route on the follower 's map .
The participants are free to speak , but they cannot see each other 's map .
The whole conversations were recorded , transcribed and properly annotated .
The collaborative performance in the task is measured by the PATHDEV variable , which quantifies the deviation between the paths drawn by interlocutors .
Larger values indicate poorer task performance .
DJD contains a set of 16 dialogues from native speakers of Danish ( 11,100 utterances and 56,600 words ) .
In Fusaroli et al. 's ( 2012 ) original study the participants were to accomplish a series of visual perception task trials , by discussing the stimuli they saw and reaching a joint decision for each trial .
The collaborative performance is measured by the CollectivePerformance variable , which is based on a psychometric function that measures the sensitivity of the dyad 's joint decision to the actual contrast difference of the trial ( Fusaroli et al. , 2012 ) .
Higher value of this variable indicates better task performance .
The Switchboard Corpus ( Godfrey et al. , 1992 ) is used to train the language model for estimating the sentence entropy in Map Task .
The Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks Corpus 1 is used for the same purpose for DJD .
Estimating information density in dialogue
The information density of language is estimated at the sentence level , by computing the per-word entropy of each sentence using a trigram language model trained from a different corpus .
We consider a sentence to be a sequence of words , S = {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n } , and the per-word entropy is estimated by : H( w 1 ...w n ) = ?
1 n w i ?W log P ( w i |w 1 ...w i?1 ) ( 1 ) where P ( w i |w 1 . . . w i?1 ) is estimated by a trigram model that is trained from an outside corpus .
The SRILM software ( Stolcke , 2002 ) is used to train the language model and to compute sentence entropy .
Dialogue is a sequence of utterances contributed by two interlocutors .
For the k th dialogue whose total utterance number is N k , we mark it as D k = { u k i | i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N k } , in which u k i is the i th utterance .
Map
Task contains annotations of sentence structure in utterances , and one utterance could consist of several sentences that are syntactically independent .
Thus we further split D k into a sequence of sentence , D k = {s k i | i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N k } , in which N k is number of sentences in D k .
Since DJD lacks the sentence annotations , we do not further split the utterance sequence , and simply treat an utterance as a complete sentence .
Given a sequence {s k i } ( Map Task ) , or {u k i } ( DJD ) , we calculate the per-word entropy for each item in the sequence : H k = { H( s k i ) or H( u k i ) | i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N k ( orN k ) } ( 2 ) where H(s k i ) or H( u k i ) is computed according to Equation 1 .
Then we split the entropy series H k into two sub-series by the source of utterances ( i.e. , who speaks them ) , resulting in H A k for interlocutor A , and H B k for interlocutor B. For Map Task , the two interlocutors have distinct roles , instruction giver and follower .
Thus the resulting two entropy series are H g k and H f k .
These per-interlocutor entropy series will be the input of our next-step spectral analysis .
Computing power spectrum overlap and relative phase
The time intervals between utterances ( or sentences ) vary , but since we care about the average information contribution within a complete semantic unit , we treat entropy series as regular time series .
The time scale is not measured in seconds but in turns ( or sentences ) .
For a given dialogue D k , we apply the fast Fourier transform ( FFT ) on its two entropy se-ries H A k and H B k , and obtain the power spectra ( or , power spectral density plots ) of them , P A k and P B k .
The power spectra are estimated with the periodogram method provided by the open source R software .
The Y axis of a power spectrum is the squared amplitude of signal ( or power ) , and X axis ranges from 0 to ?/2 ( we do not have sampling frequency , thus the X axis is in angular frequency but not in Hz ) .
The power spectrum overlap , PSO k , is calculated by computing the common area under the curves of P A k and P B k is calculated , and normalizing by the total area of the two curves ( see Figure 2 ) .
PSO k ranges from 0 to 1 , and a larger value indicates higher similarity between P A k and P B k .
Common area
Prerequisites of Spectral Analysis
Before proceeding to the actual analysis , we first examine whether the data we use satisfy some of the prerequisites of spectral analysis techniques .
One common assumption of Fourier transforms is that the signals ( time series ) are stationary ( Dwivedi and Subba Rao , 2011 ) .
Stationarity means that the mean , variance and other distributional properties do not change over time ( Natrella , 2010 ) .
Another presumption we hold is that the entropy series contain some periodic patterns ( see Section 1.1 ) , which means their power spectrum should differ from that of white noise .
Examine stationarity
We use three pervasively used statistical tests to test the stationarity of our entropy series data : the ( Dickey and Fuller , 1979 ) , the Kwiatkowski-Phillips - Schmidt - Shin ( KPSS ) test ( Kwiatkowski et al. , 1992 ) , and the Phillips - Perron ( PP ) test ( Phillips and Perron , 1988 ) .
The percentage of entropy series that pass the stationarity tests are shown in Table 1 .
We can see that the majority of our data satisfy the assumption of stationarity , and thus it is valid to conduct Fourier transform on the entropy series .
The stationarity property seems contradictory to the previous findings about entropy increase in written text and spoken dialogue ( Genzel and Charniak , 2002 ; Genzel and Charniak , 2003 ; Xu and Reitter , 2016 b ) , because stationarity predicts that the mean entropy stays constant over time .
We examine this in our data by fitting a simple linear model with entropy as the dependent , and sentence position as the independent variable , which yields significant ( marginal ) effects of the latter : For Map Task , ? = 2.3 ? 10 ?3 , p < .05 , Adj-R 2 = 1.7 ? 10 ?4 ; For DJD , ? = 7.2 ? 10 ?5 , p = .06 , Adj-R 2 = 2.2 ? 10 ?4 .
It indicates that the stationarity of entropy series does not conflict with the entropy increasing trend predicted by the principle of ERC ( Shannon , 1948 ) .
We conjecture that stationarity satisfies because the effect size ( Adj - R 2 ) of entropy increase is very small .
Comparison with white noise Power spectra for all entropy series are obtained with an FFT .
We compare them with those of white noise .
The white noise data are simulated with i.i.d. random data points that are generated from normal distributions ( same means and standard deviations as the actual data ) .
Figure 3 shows the smoothed average spectrums of the actual entropy data and the simulated white noise data .
White noise signals should demonstrate a constant power spectral density ( Narasimhan and Veena , 2005 ) , and if the entropy series is not completely random , then their average spectrum should be flat .
Linear models show that the average spectrums of the entropy data have slopes that are significantly larger than zero ( For Map Task , ) , while the slopes of the white noise data are not significantly different from zero .
This confirms our presumption that the entropy series of dialogue contains some periodic patterns that are identifiable in frequency space .
We also conduct Ljung - Box test ( Ljung and Box , 1978 ) to examine how the entropy series is different from white noise .
The null hypothesis is that the time series being tested is independent of the lagged sequence of itself .
The test on a white noise series will give big p-values , for any lags greater than 0 , because of its randomness nature .
We try several lags on each entropy series , and pick the smallest p-value .
Consequently , we obtain a mean p-value of .23 on MapTask , and a mean p-value of .27 on DJD .
Therefore , we cannot reject the null hypothesis for all the entropy series data , but the Type - I error of considering them as different form white noise is pretty low .
PSO Predicts Task Success
Results of linear models
We compute PSO for all the dialogues in Map Task and DJD and fit two linear models using PSO as predictor , with PATHDEV and CollectivePerformance as dependent variables respectively .
PSO is a reliable predictor in both models ( p < .05 ) .
The coefficients are shown in Table 2 . Since PATHDEV is a measure of failure , but collaborative task performance is a measure of success , the negative correlation between PSO and collabora-tive task performance is consistent .
Regression lines with residuals are plotted in Figure 4 . Collective -Performance - 40.9 15.9 6.60 * .271 Figure 4 ( a ) suggests a heteroscedasticity problem , because the right half of data points seem to stretch up along the y axis .
This was confirmed by a Breush - Pagan test ( Breusch and Pagan , 1979 ) ( BP = 5.62 , p < .05 ) .
To rectify this issue , we adopt a Box - Cox transformation ( Box and Cox , 1964 ) on the dependent variable , PATHDEV , which is a typical way of handling heteroscedasticity .
The new model that uses PSO to predict the Box -Cox transformed PATHDEV also yields significant coefficients : ? = 3.85 , SE = 1.67 , F ( 1 , 113 ) = 5.32 , p < .05 .
Therefore , the correlation between PSO and PATHDEV is reliable .
As for DJD , due to the lack of data ( we only have 16 dialogues ) , we do not run further diagnostics analysis on the regression model .
Discussion
The coupling of entropy series in frequency space is negatively correlated with task success .
In other words , synchrony between interlocutors in terms of their information distribution hinders the success of collaboration .
By " synchrony " , we mean an overlap in the frequencies at which they choose to inject novel information into the conversation .
This conclusion seems contradictory to the perspective of interactive alignment at the first glance .
However , here we are starting with a very highlevel model of dialogue that has does not refer to linguistic devices .
Instead , we utilize the concept of " information density " and the entropy metric of natural language , to paint the picture of a system in which communicators inject novelty into the dialogue , and that each communicator does so regularly and with a set of overlapping frequencies .
We assume that the rapid change of sentence entropy , i.e. , the high frequency components in the spectrum , correspond to the moments in conversa -q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q 0 50 100 150 200 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 PSO PATHDEV ( a) Map Task q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q 3 4 5 tion where one interlocutor brings relatively novel content to the table , such as a detailed instruction , a strange question , an unexpected response etc .
This assumption is reasonable because previous work has shown that sudden change in entropy predicts topic change in dialogue ( Genzel and Charniak , 2003 ; Qian and Jaeger , 2011 ; Xu and Reitter , 2016 b ) .
We argue that higher synchrony ( larger overlap in frequency space ) in terms of how much novelty each interlocutor contributes , does not necessarily leads to better outcomes of communication .
Rather , we would expect the correlation to be opposite ( and our empirical results confirm this ) , because dialogue is a joint activity , in which a taking on different roles as interlocutors ( e.g. , the one who gives orders versus the one who follows ) is often required to push the activity along ( Clark , 1996 ) .
A dialogue with maximal synchrony or frequency overlap would be one where partners take turns at regular intervals .
Perhaps because such regularity in turn-taking assigns no special roles to interlocutors , and because they engage in turntaking with no regard for content , it is not strange that such synchrony is disadvantageous .
Let 's look at several scenarios of different synchrony levels between interlocutors :
First , high synchrony due to both interlocutors contributing large amount of new information , which means there is more overlap near the high frequency band of spectrums .
In this case , they are more likely to have difficulty in comprehending each other due to the potential information overload .
Situations such as arguing , or both speakers asking a lot of questions are good examples .
Second , high synchrony due to both interlocutors providing ineffective information , which indicates overlap in spectrums near the low frequency band .
Obviously this type of ineffective communication is not helpful to the collaborative task .
Third , low synchrony due to one interlocutor providing more information and the other one providing less , which means the overlap in spectrums is minimum .
An example of this case is that one interlocutor is saying something important , while the other one is producing short utterances such " uh- huh " , " yes " , or short questions to make sure that they are on the same page , which is known as the back - channel mechanism in conversation ( Orestr ? m , 1983 ) .
This complementary style of communication allows them to build mutual understand of each other 's intention , and thus reaches better collaborative performance .
RP Predicts Task Success
Results of linear models
We obtain the relative phase ( RP ) vector ( absolute values ) of all frequency components , and fit linear models using the mean of RP as predictor , and task performance as the dependent variable .
We get non-significant coefficients for both models : For Map Task , F ( 1 , 113 ) = .004 , p > .05 ; for DJD , F ( 1 , 14 ) = .772 , p > .05 .
This suggests that the phase information of all frequency components in spectrum is not very indicative of task success .
The power spectra describe the distribution of energy across the span of frequency components that compose the signal .
The frequency components with higher energy ( peaks in spectrum ) are more dominant than those with lower energy ( troughs ) in determining the nature of the signal .
Therefore it makes sense to only include the peak frequencies into the model , because they are more " representative " of the signal , and so the " noise " from the low energy frequencies are filtered out .
Thus we obtain RP from the local peak frequency components , and use the mean , median , and maximum values of them as predictors .
It turns out that for Map Task , the maximum of RP is a significant predictor ( the mean and median are left out via stepwise analysis ) .
For DJD , the mean of RP is a significant predictor of task success ( when median and maximum are included in the model ) .
( see Table 3 ) .
From the significant effect of maximum RP in Map Task and mean RP in DJD , it is safe to state that RP is positively correlated with task performance .
However , this relationship is not as straight - forward as PSO , because of the marginal effect at the opposite direction .
A more finegrained analysis is required , but it is outside the scope of this study .
Discussion
The relative phase in frequency space can be understood as the " lag " between signals in time space .
Imagine that we align the two entropy series from one dialogue onto the same time scale ( just like Figure 1 ) , the distance between the entropy " peaks " is proportionate to the relative phase in frequency space .
Then , the positive correlation between relative phase and task performance suggests that relatively large delays between entropy
The delay of entropy surges can be understood as a strategy for an interlocutor to distribute information in his or her own utterance accordingly with the information received .
For example , after interlocutor A contributes a big piece of information , the other one , B , does not rush to make new substantial contributions , but instead keeps her utterances at low entropy until it is the proper time to take a turn to contribute .
This does not have to coincide with dialogic turn-taking .
This delay gives B more time to " digest " the information provided by A , which could be an instruction that needs to be comprehended , or a question that needs to be thought about and so on .
A relatively long delay guarantees enough time for interlocutors to reach mutual understanding .
On the contrary , if B rushes to speak a lot shortly after the A's input , then it will probably cause information overload and be harmful to communication .
Therefore , we believe that the RP statistic captures the extent to which interlocutors manage the proper " timing " of information contribution to maintain effective communication .
Prediction Task
Here we explore whether the frequency domain features , PSO and RP , can help with an existing framework that utilizes alignment features , such as the repetition of lexical and syntactic elements , to predict the success of dialogue in MapTask ( Reitter and Moore , 2007 ) .
R&M described an SVM model that takes into the repetition count of lexicons ( LEXREP ) and syntax structures ( SYNREP ) , and the length of dialogues ( LENGTH ) as features .
The full model achieves an R 2 score of .17 , which means that it can account for 17 % of the variance of task success .
We add the new PSO and RP ( mean , median and maximum RP features per dialogue are included ) covariates to the original SVM model .
An RBF kernel ( ? = 5 ) was used .
The cost parameter C was ( coarsely ) tuned on different cross-validation folds to reduce overfitting on this relatively small dataset , and the R&M 's original full model was recalculated ( shown in Table 4 as R&M ) .
Two models with PSO and RP interactions ( once without the alignment / repetition features ) are shown for comparison .
( See Table 4 ) .
Significant improvement in the model 's explanatory power , i.e. , R 2 , is gained after the PSO and RP features are added .
The best model we have is by adding PSO and RP as predictors without the interaction term ( bold number in Table 4 ) , which gives about 60 % increase of R 2 compared to R&M 's full model .
Note that even if we exclude the alignment features , and include only ( LENGTH ) and the frequency features ( last row in Table 4 ) , the performance also exceeds R& M 's full model .
The results indicate that the frequency domain features ( PSO and RP ) of the sentence information density can capture some hidden factors of task success that are unexplained by the alignment approach .
It is not surprising that how people coordinate their information contribution matters a lot to the success of the collaboration .
What we show here is that regular , repeated patterns of information - dense and information - sparse turns seem to make speakers more or less compatible with each other .
Whether individuals have typical patterns ( frequency distributions ) of information density , or whether this is a result of dynamic interaction in each particular dialogue , remains to be seen .
Conclusions
The empirical results of the present study suggest that examining how the information contribution from interlocutors co-develops can provide a way to understand dialogue from a higher - level perspective , which has been missing in existing work .
Our work adds a brick to the series of endeavors on studying the linguistic and behavioral factors of successful dialogue , and for the first time ( as far as we know ) demonstrates quantitatively that the dynamics of not just " what " and " how " we say , but also " how much " we say and the " timing " of distributing what we say in dialogue , are relevant to the quality of communication .
Although the way we model information in language is simply the entropy at lexical level , we believe the findings still reveal the nature of information production and processing in dialogue .
We hope that by comparing and combining our methodology with other approaches of studying dialogue , we can reach a more comprehensive and holistic understanding of this common yet mysterious human practice .
