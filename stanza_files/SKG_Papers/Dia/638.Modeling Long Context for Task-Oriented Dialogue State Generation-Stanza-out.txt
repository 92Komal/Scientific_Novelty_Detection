Modeling Long Context for Task-Oriented Dialogue State Generation
abstract
Based on the recently proposed transferable dialogue state generator ( TRADE ) that predicts dialogue states from utterance - concatenated dialogue context , we propose a multi-task learning model with a simple yet effective utterance tagging technique and a bidirectional language model as an auxiliary task for task - oriented dialogue state generation .
By enabling the model to learn a better representation of the long dialogue context , our approaches attempt to solve the problem that the performance of the baseline significantly drops when the input dialogue context sequence is long .
In our experiments , our proposed model achieves a 7.03 % relative improvement over the baseline , establishing a new state - of - the - art joint goal accuracy of 52.04 % on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset .
Introduction
Dialogue state tracking ( DST , also known as belief tracking ) predicts user 's goals in task - oriented dialogue system , where dialogue states are normally represented in the form of a set of slot-value pairs .
A variety of approaches to dialogue state tracking are devoted to dealing with two different settings : DST over a predefined domain ontology and DST with slot-value candidates from an open vocabulary .
Most of the previous work is based on the first setting , assuming that all possible slot-value candidates are provided in a domain ontology in advance .
The task of the dialogue state tracking with this setting is therefore largely simplified to score all predefined slot-value pairs and select the value with the highest score for each slot as the final prediction .
Although predefined ontology - based approaches are successfully used on datasets with small ontologies , such as DSTC2 ( Henderson et al. , 2014 ) and WOZ2.0 , they are *
Corresponding author quite limited in both scalability to scenarios with infinite slot values and prediction of unseen slot values .
In order to address these issues of DST over predefined ontologies , recent efforts have been made to predict slot-value pairs in open vocabularies .
Among them , TRADE proposes to encode the entire dialogue context and to predict the value for each slot using a copy -augmented decoder , achieving state - of - the - art results on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset .
As TRADE simply concatenates all the system and user utterances in previous turns into a single sequence as the dialogue context for slot-value prediction , it is difficult for the model to identify whether an utterance in the dialogue context is from system or user when the concatenated sequence becomes long .
We observe that the longest dialogue context after concatenation on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset contains 880 tokens .
Our experiments also demonstrate that the longer the dialogue context sequence is , the worse TRADE performs .
To deal with this problem , we propose two approaches to modeling long context for better dialogue state tracking .
The first method is tagging .
While constructing the dialogue context sequence , we insert a tag of [ sys ] symbol in front of each system utterance , and a tag of [ usr ] symbol in front of each user utterance .
The purpose of adding such symbolic tags in the concatenated dialogue context sequence is to explicitly enhance the capability of the model in distinguishing system and user utterances .
In the second method , we propose to integrate a bi-directional language modeling module into the upstream of the model as an auxiliary task to gain better understanding and representation of the dialogue context .
The bi-directional language modeling task is to predict the next word by using forward hidden states and the previous word by using backward hidden states based on the dialogue context sequence without any annotation .
With these two approaches , we perform dialogue state tracking in a multi-task learning architecture .
In summary , the contributions of our work are as follows : ?
We propose a simple tagging method to explicitly separate system from user utterances in the concatenated dialogue context . ?
We propose a language modeling task as an auxiliary task to better model long context for DST .
?
We conduct experiments on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset .
Both methods achieve significant improvements over the baselines in all evaluation metrics .
The joint of the two methods establish a new state - of- the - art results on the MultiWOZ 2.0 .
In addition , we provide a detailed analysis on the improvements achieved by our methods .
Related Work Predefined ontology - based DST assumes that all slot-value pairs are provided in an ontology .
propose a neural belief tracker ( NBT ) to leverage semantic information from word embeddings by using distributional representation learning for DST .
An extension to the NBT is then proposed by Mrk?i? and Vuli ? ( 2018 ) , which learns to update belief states automatically .
2018 ) introduce an approach that fully utilizes semantic similarity between dialogue utterances and the ontology terms .
Ren et al. ( 2018 ) propose StateNet which generates a fixed - length representation of the dialogue context and compares the distances between this representation and the value vectors in the candidate set for making prediction .
These predefined ontology - based DST approaches suffer from their weak scalability to large ontologies and cannot deal with previously unseen slot values .
In open vocabulary - based DST , Xu and Hu ( 2018 ) propose a model that learns to predict unknown values by using the index - based pointer network for different slots .
apply an encoder-decoder architecture to generate dialogue states with the copy mechanism .
However , their method simply concatenates the whole dialogue context as input and does not perform well when the dialogue context is long .
We study this problem and propose methods to help the DST model better model long context .
Inspired by who use an additional language model in question generation , we attempt to incorporate language modeling into dialogue state tracking as an auxiliary task .
Our Methods
In this section , we describe our proposed methods .
First , section 3.1 briefly introduces the recent TRADE model as background knowledge , followed by our methods : utterance tagging in section 3.2 and multi-task learning with language modeling in section 3.3 .
Transferable Dialogue State Generator TRADE is an encoder-decoder model that encodes concatenated previous system and user utterances as dialogue context and generates slot value word by word for each slot exploring the copy mechanism .
The architecture of TRADE is shown in Figure 1 without the language model module .
In the encoder of TRADE , system and user utterances in previous dialogue turns are simply concatenated without any labeling .
In our experiments , we find that the performance of the TRADE model significantly drops when the length of the dialogue context is long .
On the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset , the maximum length of a dialogue context is up to 880 tokens .
About 27 % of instances on the test set have dialogue context sequences longer than 200 tokens .
The joint accuracy of the TRADE on these cases drops to lower than 22 % .
This suggests that TRADE suffers from long context .
Utterance Tagging
To deal with this problem , we first propose a simple method to label system and user utterances by inserting a tag of [ sys ] just at the beginning of each system utterance and a tag of [ usr ] in front of each user utterance when they are concatenated into the dialogue context .
We conjecture that mixing system and user utterances in one single sequence may confuse the encoder .
It may also mislead the decoder to attend to inappropriate parts and the copy network to copy from wrong utterances .
The
Multi-task Learning with Language Modeling
We further propose to incorporate a bi-directional language modeling module into the dialogue state tracking model in a multi-task learning framework for DST , which is shown in Figure 1 .
The bi-directional language modeling module is to predict the next word and the previous word in the concatenated sequence with the forward and the backward GRU network respectively .
We first feed the concatenated dialogue context into the embedding layer .
We initialize each word embedding in the dialogue context by concatenating Glove embedding ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) and character embedding ( Hashimoto et al. , 2017 ) .
This word embedding sequence is then fed into a bi-directional GRU network to get the hidden representations ?
h lm t and ?
h lm t in two directions , which are used to predict the next and the previous word through a softmax layer as follows : P lm ( w t+1 |w < t +1 ) = sof tmax ( W f ? h lm t ) ( 1 ) P lm ( w t?1 |w >t?1 ) = sof tmax ( W b ? h lm t ) ( 2 )
The loss function is defined as the sum of the negative log-likelihood of the next and previous words in the sequence .
The language modeling loss L lm is therefore calculated as follows ( T is the length of the concatenated dialogue context sequence ) : L lm = ? T ?1 t=1 log ( P lm ( w t +1 |w < t +1 ) ) ?
T t=2 log ( P lm ( w t?1 |w >t?1 ) ) ( 3 )
The sum of the forward and backward hidden states in the language model module is used as the hidden representation h lm t for word w t in the dialogue context : h lm t = ?
h lm t + ? h lm t .
We further sum it with the word embedding of w t and feed the sum into the utterance encoder .
Following , we include the slot gate and state generator modules in our model and calculate the dialogue state tracking loss L dst .
The training objective for the multi-task learning framework is to minimize the total loss L total which is the sum of DST and language modeling loss : L total = L dst + ?L lm ( 4 ) where ? is a hyper-parameter which is used to balance the two tasks .

Experiments
In this section , we evaluated our proposed methods on the public dataset .
Datasets & Settings
We conducted experiments on the MultiWOZ 2.0 which is the largest multi-domain task - oriented dialogue dataset , consisting of over 10,000 dialogues from seven domains .
Each dialogue is composed of 13.68 turns on average .
Following , we used five domains excluding hospital and police domains which account for a small portion and do not appear on the test set .
In our multi-task learning model , both the sizes of hidden states and word embeddings were set to 400 .
We set the batch size to 8 and applied the delay update mechanism with different step sizes to train the model .
Results Joint accuracy and slot accuracy are the two metrics we used to evaluate the performance on dialogue state tracking .
+ language modeling ) significantly outperforms several previous state - of - the - art models , including TRADE , and achieves new state - of - the - art results , 52.04 % of joint accuracy and 97.26 % of slot accuracy on the MultiWOZ 2.0 .
The tagging alone ( - LM ) can improve the joint accuracy on the Mul-tiWOZ 2.0 by 1.53 % while the auxiliary language modeling ( - Tagging ) by 2.74 % .
Figure 2 shows the impact of ? and the number of delay update steps on DST .
Consequently , our model performs best when we set ? to 0.9 and the number of delay update steps to 4 .
Analysis
We further provide a deep analysis on our results on the MultiWOZ 2.0 according to the length of concatenated dialogue context , which are shown in Table 2 .
We can clearly observe that the performance of the baseline model drops sharply with the increase of the dialogue context length .
We can also find that our model performs better than the baseline in all cases , suggesting that the proposed methods are able to improve modeling long dialogue context for DST .
Table 3 shows the statistics of different kinds of prediction errors on the test set of the MultiWOZ 2.0 .
We define three types of dialogue state prediction errors .
Over prediction is that the predicted states not only fully cover the golden states , but also include some redundant slot values .
Partial prediction is an error that the predicted states are just part of the golden states with some slot values missing .
False prediction denotes that false slot values are predicted for some slots .
As shown in Table 3 , our model significantly reduces the number of partial and false prediction errors , with the help of better representation of dialogue context .
Conclusion
In this paper , we have presented the utterance tagging and auxiliary bi-directional language modeling in a multi-task learning framework to model long dialogue context for open vocabulary - based DST .
Experiments on the MultiWOZ 2.0 dataset show that our model significantly outperforms the baselines and achieves new state - of - the - art results .
