Dependency Parsing with your Eyes : Dependency Structure Predicts Eye Regressions During Reading
abstract
Backward saccades during reading have been hypothesized to be involved in structural reanalysis , or to be related to the level of text difficulty .
We test the hypothesis that backward saccades are involved in online syntactic analysis .
If this is the case we expect that saccades will coincide , at least partially , with the edges of the relations computed by a dependency parser .
In order to test this , we analyzed a large eye-tracking dataset collected while 102 participants read three short narrative texts .
Our results show a relation between backward saccades and the syntactic structure of sentences .
Introduction Written language consists of a sequence of graphic signs .
While most eye movements during reading indeed follow this sequential order , they are also occasionally interleaved with jumps back to words in preceding portions of the text .
We refer to these backward saccades as regressions throughout this paper .
There are at least two competing hypotheses concerning the nature and function of this phenomenon .
The first main line of hypotheses on the role of regressions emphasizes their active role in computing linguistic representations ( Kennedy , 1992 ) , the second stresses their function as a reanalysis tool in the event of detected parsing errors ( Rayner and Sereno , 1994 ) .
In this paper we start from the former ; in particular , we aim to investigate the relation between regressions and the structure of sentences as computed by a dependency parser .
We take dependency structures as a valid approximation of syntactic properties of the sentences , and we investigate whether these are reflected in eye movement regressions during naturalistic text reading .
We consider regressions from each word in the text , and relate those to dependency relations that link pairs of words in the sentence .
In this way we can represent syntactic properties of the sentences as shallow structural information at the word level , by focusing on the number and direction of the syntactic relations that each word in a sentence is engaged in .
The aim of this paper is two -fold : on the one hand we want to investigate whether regressions might play a role in online sentence parsing ; on the other hand - as an implication of the previous goal - we are interested in finding traces of syntactic parsing during reading .
We report the results of a mixed -effect regression analysis showing a relation between the pattern of eye regressions and the syntactic structure of sentences .
2 Theoretical Background
The Role of Regressions in Text Comprehension Regressions ( backward saccades ) are relatively rare , occurring usually only with 15 to 25 % of the words ( Rayner & Pollatsek , 1989 ) .
They do not seem to be random , however .
Regressions typically aim at specific word locations , moving fixation from the current word back to one of the previously encountered words ( Vitu , 2005 ) .
Nonethe-less their function in language comprehension is still debated .
Here we will review two proposed explanations : the first links regressions to the difficulty of text processing ; the second instead sees them as tools for language processing , not necessarily linked to processing difficulties or errors .
According to the first proposal regressions only start to play a role in reading once difficulties are encountered ; according to the second proposal they are part and parcel of regular reading .
Regression as a Response to Comprehension Difficulty
The first hypothesis interprets regressions as part of the reanalysis of textual input due to encountered comprehension problems .
In a milestone study , Altmann et al . ( 1992 ) introduced the notion of regression - contingent analysis , based on the assumption that regressive eye movements are a necessary consequence of subjects being gardenpathed .
A garden - path effect occurs when readers incrementally construct an incorrect interpretation of a sentence as a consequence of its locally ambiguous syntactic structure .
This does not necessarily mean that the presence of a difficult structure , leading for instance to the reader being garden - pathed , triggers a regression .
Rayner and colleagues reported data showing that strong garden path effects can occur sometimes without triggering any regressions ( Rayner and Sereno , 1994 ; Castelhano and Rayner , 2008 ) .
Nonetheless , other studies have given support to the idea that regressions are linked to textual ambiguity and contextual difficulties .
Readers make more regressions when the text is complex ( Rayner and Pollatsek , 1995 ) , when the topic changes ( Hyn , 1995 ) , when the text contains grammatical errors or ambiguities ( Reichle et al. , 2013 ) , or when they encounter information that disambiguates the preceding text ( Blanchard and IranNejad , 1987 ; Frazier and Rayner , 1982 ) .
The general hypothesis holds that the probability of regressions and their span might depend on the difficulty of the text .
Therefore these regressions might allow the reader to reread information that has been missed , forgotten , or wrongly interpreted ( Rayner , 1998 ) .
Regression as a Tool for Comprehension
The alternative explanation focuses instead on the role of eye movements as a tool in language processing , used independently from the structural difficulty of the input .
The idea is that regressions help the reader reactivate cognitive information that is associated with the regressed - to location .
Kennedy ( 1992 ) refers to this as the Spatial Code Hypothesis .
The hypothesis is that readers use the position of words on the page as a support to their working memory by reactivating previously read words associated with information relevant for the processing of the word from which the regression originated ( O'Regan , 1992 ; Spivey et al. , 2004 ) .
This hypothesis has been criticized by Booth and Weger ( 2013 ) .
They presented three experiments showing that reader comprehension is not hindered when reading conditions inhibit or discourage visual access to already read material .
In their Experiment 1 , readers knew that candidate targets for regression were no longer available for rereading .
Experiment 2 discouraged regressions by forcing readers to follow a visual placeholder on the stimulus while it was also presented in auditory form .
Finally , in Experiment 3 , candidate targets for regression were manipulated after reading .
In all these three experiments , readers showed no hindered comprehension of the presented stimulus sentences .
As an entailment of these results , Booth and Weger suggested that readers do not use regressions to cue their memory for previously read words .
Our hypothesis is that readers might make use of regressions to reactivate previously read information in the context of naturalistic language comprehension , in order to help compute linguistic information .
We want to examine whether there is an alignment between patterns of regressions and word-toword syntactic relations as described by the dependency structure of the stimulus .
We hypothesize that regressions play a role in syntactic parsing that may go beyond the reanalysis of ambiguous material .
We do not deny their role in reanalysis and repair , but we rather stand with the hypothesis that they allow re-reading and cueing of previous words , as an aid to memory , when this is required for a successful construction of a syntactic representation of the text .
In order to test this hypothesis we rely on an eye-tracker dataset that was collected during normal text reading of unmodified literary narratives .
We assess whether there is a relation between the number of eye regressions from the words and the number of syntactic relations that those words en-tertain with their preceding text .
These syntactic relations are derived from the dependency structures ( described in Section 4 ) of the sentences composing the stimuli of the eye-tracker dataset .
Regressions and Sequence Processing
The hypothesized relation between dependency structure and eye movement taps into a broader debate on whether language processing relies mainly on the sequential structure of the input or whether it involves the computation of non-sequential syntactic parses ( Jackendoff and Wittenberg , 2014 ) .
Undeniably , the linguistic stimulus is presented as a string of symbols , nonetheless regressions seem to counter the notion that it is processed strictly in a sequential order .
If these eye movements are involved only in re-analysis , then their existence does not necessarily contradict sequential processing accounts .
They can be explained as an " emergency recovery " operation that takes place only in cases of processing difficulties .
On the other hand , if we find evidence of a relation between saccades and syntactic dependency structures independent from processing difficulty , then we might conclude that saccades offer behavioral evidence that processing involves the computation of nonsequential structures .
This question is related to the line of research in psycholinguistics and neuroscience investigating the computation of syntactic structures in the mind / brain during language processing .
In this context , sequential structures are usually contrasted with hierarchical ones , where input items are grouped into larger units , which in turn are ( possibly recursively ) grouped in even larger units .
These larger units are commonly referred to as syntactic constituents or phrases and have a central position in theoretical linguistics ( Chomsky , 1965 ; Jackendoff , 2002 Jackendoff , , 2007 ) .
An increasing amount of evidence against a strictly hierarchical processing of language has emerged over the past decades .
Psycholinguistic studies have supplied evidence suggesting that the mere sequential properties of the stimulus are sufficient to explain aspects of human behavior during reading and listening .
Frank et al. ( 2012 ) provide a review of evidence from cognitive neuroscience , psycholinguistics and computational modeling studies supporting the hypothesis that hierarchical structure may not play a central role in language processing and acquisition , and that sequential structure instead has a significant explanatory power .
They argue that hierarchical structure is rarely needed to explain behavioral and neural correlates of language processing in vivo .
In contrast with these findings , recent neuroimaging studies have delineated a slightly more complex landscape in which both hierarchical and sequential processing may be carried out simultaneously by the human brain during language processing ( Brennan et al. , 2016 ; Nelson et al. , 2017 ) .
Dependency parses are different from constituency parses as they lack the non-terminal nodes characteristic of constituency parses .
Nonetheless they still constitute a non-sequential type of structure .
Demonstrating a relation between eye movement and such structure will provide evidence for the non-sequentiality of language processing , at least in the context of text reading .
Related Work
The present work studies the relation between eye movements during reading and the dependency structure as produced by a dependency parser ( see Section 5.2 for more details ) .
Several other studies tested language processing hypotheses by using computational models as predictors of eye movements during sentence reading .
Boston et al. ( 2008 ) demonstrates the importance of including parsing costs implemented as surprisal as a predictor of comprehension difficulty in models of reading .
They showed that surprisal of grammatical structures has an effect on fixation durations and regression probabilities .
Demberg and Keller ( 2008 ) compared linguistic integration cost computed as a function of dependency relations distances and word surprisal as predictors of gaze duration .
They showed that distance is not a significant predictor of reading times except for nouns .
On the other hand , they demonstrate that surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the corpus , concluding that the two predictors may capture distinct aspects of naturalistic language processing .
In the context of Natural Language Processing , Klerke et al. ( 2015 ) used eye-tracker data as a metric for the quality of automatic text simplification and compression , which are operations used in machine translation and automatic summarization .
Their proposal is grounded in the hypothesis that eye movements are related to perceived text diffi- culty ( Rayner and Pollatsek , 1995 ) , one of the two hypothesis we have introduced in Section 2 above .
Dependency Structure
We chose dependency grammar as the formalism of non-sequential syntactic structure .
Dependency grammar describes a sentence as a set of relations between words ( heads ) and their dependents .
These relations are called dependencies and correspond to grammatical functions and - together with the words they link - are the only descriptive elements composing the structure , which has the form and properties of a directed graph ( Tesni ?re et al. , 2015 ; Mel'?uk , 1988 ; Nivre and K?bler , 2009 ) . ( 1 ) Peter bought a very expensive luxury car .
Take for instance Sentence 1 above .
Figure 1 contains the dependency graph representing the dependency structure of the sentence in terms of typified head - dependent relations .
The main verb ( bought ) acts as head for Peter and car , with which it is in subject and object relations , respectively .
A dependent of one dependency relation can in turn be the head of another one .
For instance car is head of luxury and of expensive with which it is linked by modifier relations , and also head of the article a via a determiner relation .
This structure lacks phrasal non-terminal constituents .
In addition , it is not strictly sequential , or put differently , it is not isomorphic to the sequence of items that makes up the stimulus .
This is based on the fact that the dependency relations can hold between words that are non-consecutive or possibly even far apart in the sentence .
There is the assumption that during reading , these links are created once a suitable candidate for the second term of the dependency is introduced .
Therefore , online dependency parsing proceeds by introducing one word at a time , and by looking back at the prefix in order to assess whether this novel input is a suitable candidate for a dependency link with a preceding word that has not yet been matched .
Materials and Methods
Eye-tracker data
The eye tracker data used in this study was originally collected for a study on mental stimulation during literary reading by Mak and Willems ( 2018 ) at Radboud University , Nijmegen , the Netherlands .
For more details on data acquisition and preprocessing we refer to the original publication .
Participants and Stimuli Data was collected from 102 participants ( 82 females , mean age 23.27 , range 18 - 40 ) , all of whom were native speakers of Dutch , with normal or corrected - to-normal vision .
All participants gave written informed consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki .
Stimuli consisted of three published short stories in Dutch .
Stories 1 and 2 were written by contemporary Dutch writers , and Story 3 was translated from American English to Dutch .
Their lengths were 2143 , 2659 , and 2988 words respectively , and they required around 10 - 15 minutes each to be read .
Data Acquisition and Pre-processing For eye-movement data collection , a monocular desktop-mounted EyeLink 1000 + eye-tracking system was used ( 500 Hz sampling rate ) .
Head movements were minimized using a head stabilizer , ensuring that all participants were seated at 108 cm from the screen .
The stimuli were presented using SR Research Experiment Builder software ( SR Research , Ottawa , Canada ) .
The stories were divided into 30 sections each .
The stories were presented in counterbalanced order .
After data collection , participants were presented with a comprehension questionnaire .
All fixations were checked to make sure that they did not drift off and enter a different interest area .
If correction of the drifts was not possible , individual sections were excluded .
Data for at least one section was removed for 40 participants .
For four participants , the number of excluded sections exceeded six , resulting in the exclusion of one story for these participants .
Eight participants answered more than one comprehension question incorrectly for one of the three stories ( four times for Story 2 and four times for Story 3 ) , resulting in the exclusion of the data for one story reading for eight participants .
The dataset contains a total of 582,807 words across all participants and narratives .
Eye Tracker Measures
For the present study we focus on the number of eye regressions .
A regression consists of a fast eye movement from a word back to a previous word .
Dependency Parsing
The text of the three stories presented to the participants were fed to the ALPINO toolbox for Dutch natural language processing ( Noord , 2006 ) to generate a dependency parse for each of their sentences .
The parser creates a structure composed of dependency triples consisting of a head word , the type of dependency relation and its dependent word .
A parse is produced for each sentence independently , therefore no relation can be assigned between words belonging to different sentences .
The output of the parser was manually checked in order to prevent tokenization and sentence segmentation errors .
Number of Dependency Relations
As described in Section 4 , every word in a sentence entertains at least one relation with another word in the same sentence .
Every non-final and non-initial word can have relations with a variable number of other words on its right and its left .
Because we are interested in eye regressions , we decided to focus our attention only on relations between a word w and its preceding context .
Therefore only relations with a head and possible dependents on the words preceding w are counted .
From the dependency structure of a sentence , we derived the following count measures : ?
N head indicates the presence of a syntactic relation between w i and a word in w 1:i?1 that is head of w i ; ?
N dependents counts the number of syntactic relations between w i and words in w 1:i?1 that are dependents of w i .
Measure N head is a binary variable indicating whether word w has a head in its left context w 1:t?1 .
This is because every word has one , and only one , head .
For example , the word expensive in Sentence 1 has one head relation with a word on its right Peter bought a very expensive luxury car ( car ) , no dependents on its right , and one on its left ( very ) .
On the other hand , the word car , being sentence -final , does not have any links on its right , but it has 1 head ( bought ) and 3 dependents ( a , expensive , luxury ) on its left .
Table 1 contains the count measures ( N head and N dependents ) for Sentence 1 .
N head 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 N dependents 0 1 0 0 1 0 3
Descriptors not Related to Dependencies
We are interested in the effect of syntactic structure , implemented as dependency relations , on the pattern of regressions .
For this reason it is necessary to control for other possible quantifiable factors affecting these eye movements .
We chose to use log-transformed lexical frequency and surprisal .
Base - 2 log-transformed lexical frequency per word was computed using the Subtlex NL corpus ( Keuleers et al. , 2010 ) .
Surprisal was computed from a second-order Markov model , also known as trigram model , trained on a random selection of 10 million sentences ( comprising 197 million word tokens ; 2.1 million types ) from the Dutch section of Corpora from the Web ( NLCOW2012 ; Sch?fer and Bildhauer , 2012 ) .
Surprisal of word w t is the negative logarithm of the conditional probability of encountering w t after having read sequence w t?2 , w t?1 , or : ? log P ( w t |w t?2 , w t?1 ) .
The computation was performed by the SRILM toolbox ( Stolcke , 2002 ) .
Frequency and surprisal are computed in order to control for processing difficulties .
Intuitively , infrequent words and words with high surprisal are more difficult to retrieve ( and possibly to integrate ) with their preceding context .
Controlling for processing difficulty is motivated by the alternative hypothesis regarding the role of regressions as depending on the level of complexity posed by a linguistic input .
In addition to frequency and surprisal , we also use word position in the sentence .
Intuitively , the probability of regressing from a word to its previous context increases linearly with the position of the word in a sequence .
By controlling for it , we ensure that the eye movements are not due simply to the opportunity given by the larger target pool to regress to .
Analyses
We fitted two logistic mixed - effect models predicting eye regressions .
The first model ( null , Eq. ( 1 ) below ) contains as predictors only the position of the words in their sentences ( word order ) , and probabilistic information consisting of the abovementioned log-transformed frequency ( freq ) and surprisal ( surp ) .
The second model ( full , Eq. ( 2 ) below ) contains as predictors of interest also the number of left - hand side dependency relations ( i.e. N head and N dependents ) of each word .
In addition , we included by -participant and by -word random intercepts , as well as by -participant random slopes for word order in the null model and for word order , N head and N dependents in the full models .
We expect the model 's fit to improve significantly after inclusion of the measures derived from the dependency parse as regressors .
The increase in model fit is quantified by the ?
2 - statistic of a likelihood - ratio test for significance between the null and full models and is taken as the measure of the fit of N head and N dependents measures at each word to the probability of a regression being generated at each word .
null : eye regressions ? word order + surp + freq + ( 1 | word ) + ( 1 + word order | participant ) full : eye regressions ? word order + surp + freq + N head + N dependents + ( 1 | word ) + ( 1 + word order + N head + N dependents | participant ) ( 2 ) The models are fit by maximum likelihood ( Laplace Approximation ) and with a binomial distribution .
Results
Regression Model Analysis
In the results below we first describe the fit of each of the two models ( null and full ) separately , then we report the results of the model comparison analysis using the ?
2 - statistic .
Table 2 presents the fitted null model .
Table 3 shows the fitted full model .
The head and dependent regressors have significant effects on the number of regressions ( eye regressions ) - N head : ? = 0.242 , p < .0001 ; N dependents : ? = 0.046 , p < .0005 .
In addition , both word frequency ( freq ) and surprisal ( surp ) have a significant negative effect .
The negative effect of frequency might be due to less frequent words being more difficult to retrieve from memory , therefore triggering a regression to gather more contextual information to help word processing .
The negative effect of surprisal indicates that the larger the surprisal of a word - therefore more difficult its integration into the context - the less probable the reader is to regress to the word 's previous context .
Mak and Willems ( 2018 ) reported a positive effect of surprisal on the number of incoming saccades , that is , eye movements into a word back from subsequent parts of the text .
In order to test whether the introduction of head and dependent measures improves the fit of the logistic mixed effect model to outgoing saccades , we computed the ?
2 - statistic of a likelihood - ratio test for the difference between the null and full models above .
The ?
2 is taken as the measure of the fit of the dependency measures to the probability of a regression being initiated at each word .
Table 4 reports the results of the test , showing the difference in model fit to be significant ( ? 2 = 738.87 , p < .0001 ) .
Analysis of Regression Counts
The results of the regression model comparison indicate that regressions are partially driven by the presence of left - hand side dependency relations .
In order to corroborate these observations , we counted the number of times regressions generated from each word do actually land on preceding words that are heads or dependents of that word .
As reported in Table 5 , it turns out that of the 110,336 regressions , about 40 % do actually land on a head or dependent of the words they originate from .
These are referred to as matches .
The analyses were limited only to regressions landing within sentence boundaries .
In the table , " misses " refers to the regressions that land on targets that are neither head nor dependent of the the word they originated from .
tot nr of regressions : 110336 tot nr of matches : 46378 tot nr of misses : 63958 Table 5 : Total numbers of regressions , matches ( i.e. regressions that land on heads or dependents ) , and misses ( i.e. regressions do not land on heads or dependents of the word they originated from ) .
A ? 2 - test of independence was performed to assess the relation between having a dependency relation with a word and generating a regression to that word .
The test was computed independently for 10 separate left- hand side distances d = [ ?10 : ?1 ] .
In other words , for d = ?1 , we want to assess whether there is a relation between having a dependency relation with the preceding word and looking back at that word ; for d = ?2 , we want to assess whether there is a relation between having a dependency relation with the preceding word at position ?2 and looking back at that word , and so on for the other considered distances .
Table 6 contains the per-distance results of the ?
2 analyses .
An association between presence of a dependency relation at position d and the generation of a regression to that position is significant for distances ?1 ( ? 2 = 132.52 , p < 0.001 ) , ?2 ( ? 2 = 678.14 , p < 0.001 ) , ?3 ( ? 2 = 8.05 , p < 0.005 ) , and ?4 ( ? 2 = 13.68 , p < 0.001 ) .
For all other tested distances ( between ?5 and ?10 ) the association was not significant ( see Figure 2 ) .
For
This seems to indicate that the effect of the dependency structure of a sentence on the pattern of outgoing eye-movements from a word is present only for short- distance relations ( between a word and its four preceding words ) .
d = {?1 , ?2 , ?3 , ?4 } : It is important to keep in mind however that the number of dependency relations found by the parser is much higher than the actual number of matches .
This is simply because the parser does assign at least a head to each and every word in the text ( even words in isolation are assigned a root head ) , whereas a regression is a relatively rare event ( under normal conditions , using naturalistic language ) .
The present work aims at demonstrating that regressions are related ( also ) to the structure of the dependency graph .
The results we have produced so far point in that direction .
In other words , it is possible to affirm that if a regression takes place , it might be triggered by the presence of a dependency relation between the word it is generated from and the word it lands on .
Conclusion
In this paper we have presented an analysis investigating whether eye movements of readers may be influenced directly by the syntactic structure of the sentence .
We tested this using shallow nonhierarchical structures computed by a dependency parser .
The hypothesis was that the path of regressions from a word to an earlier word coincide , at least partially , with the edges of dependency relations between these words .
We used a substantially large eye-tracking dataset collected while 102 participants were engaged in reading three short narrative texts .
The results of a mixed -effect regression analysis indicate that there is a significant effect of the number of left - hand side dependency relations on the number of backward saccades .
This effect is well above chance even after correcting for word position in the sentence and word frequency and surprisal - measures held to explain a large part of natural language processing behavioral and neural correlates .
These results are corroborated by the observation that about 40 % of backward saccades do indeed land on target words engaged in dependency relations according to the syntactic structure of the sentences composing our stimuli .
The length of the regressions seems to be relatively short : the vast majority being shorter than three words , with a predominance of regressions one position backwards .
The results of a series of ?
2 tests for independence shows that there is a significant association between presence of a dependency link and backward saccading between two words holds only for pairs which are not further apart than four positions .
This might indicate that the eye regressions are involved predominantly in dependency parsing at the local level , rather than at long distance .
Altogether these results converge on the idea that eye movements reflect , among other things , the shallow syntactic structure of language .
Moreover these results seems also to corroborate the idea that humans do engage in online syntactic analysis of the input - at least in the form of local dependency parsing .
