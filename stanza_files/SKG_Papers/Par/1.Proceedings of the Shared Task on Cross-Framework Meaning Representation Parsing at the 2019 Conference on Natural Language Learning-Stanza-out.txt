Preface
We are excited ( and a little relieved ) to present the proceedings from the 2019 Shared Task on Cross - Framework Meaning Representation Parsing ( MRP ) at the Conference for Computational Language Learning ( CoNLL ) .
This volume provides linguistic , methodological , and technical background to the target representations , mode of operation , and participating systems in a ' system bake - off ' for datadriven parsing into graph-structured representations of sentence meaning .
The task received submissions from eighteen teams , of which two involved task co-organizers and do not participate in the official ranking of submissions .
Three teams declined the invitation to submit a system description for publication in the proceedings , such that the volume in total comprises an indepth task overview , two ' system descriptions ' by task co-organizers , and thirteen system descriptions by task participants .
All system descriptions were reviewed by at least three experts , drawing from among the task participants and an external pool of colleagues working in meaning representation parsing .
We much look forward to the presentation of results and meeting with task participants in person at CoNLL in early November 2019 .
The conference has allocated a 90 - minute slot for oral presentations from the shared task , where all teams will have the opportunity to present a ' blitz ' overview of their work .
Following this plenary session , there will be poster presentations by all teams , allowing for more detailed technical discussions .
The shared task has been an intensive experience for organizers and participants alike , with data preparation , definition of evaluation metrics , system development , submission of parser outputs , scoring and compilation of the task proceedings - running near-continuously between March and October 2019 .
We are deeply grateful to all participants ( including several who in the end did not make a submission ) for the time and effort they have invested in system development and documentation .
With no less than five distinct linguistic frameworks for graph - based meaning representation combined for the first time in a uniform training and evaluation setting , this was not an easy competition to enter .
As coorganizers of the MRP 2019 competition , we will continue to work on facilitating cross-framework meaning representation parsing and enabling participants to further build on their work .
We are delighted ( and a litte scared ) to confirm that there will be a follow - up shared task MRP 2020 at the next CoNLL meeting a year from now .
Many colleagues have made essential contributions to the task organization along the way .
We gratefully acknowledge assistance by Emily M. Bender , Jayeol Chun , Dan Flickinger , Andrey Kutuzov , Sebastian Schuster , Milan Straka , and Zde?ka Ure?ov ?.
