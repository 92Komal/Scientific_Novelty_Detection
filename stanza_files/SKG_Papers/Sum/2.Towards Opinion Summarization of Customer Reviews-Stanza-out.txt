title
Towards Opinion Summarization of Customer Reviews
abstract
In recent years , the number of texts has grown rapidly .
For example , most reviewbased portals , like Yelp or Amazon , contain thousands of user-generated reviews .
It is impossible for any human reader to process even the most relevant of these documents .
The most promising tool to solve this task is a text summarization .
Most existing approaches , however , work on small , homogeneous , English datasets , and do not account to multi-linguality , opinion shift , and domain effects .
In this paper , we introduce our research plan to use neural networks on user- generated travel reviews to generate summaries that take into account shifting opinions over time .
We outline future directions in summarization to address all of these issues .
By resolving the existing problems , we will make it easier for users of review-sites to make more informed decisions .
Introduction
In recent years , amount of available text corpora has been growing rapidly with increasing popularity of web .
Users produce a huge amount of text every day .
With a larger amount of text and information included within it , it becomes impossible for people to read all the texts and it leads to information overload .
For a common human , it is not possible to read all the available text even if he reads only all the most relevant ones .
The task of text summarization is known for a very long period .
In late 50s Luhn ( Luhn , 1958 ) tried to create abstract of documents automatically .
Over decades there have been many summarization systems dealing with different forms of summarization .
This task belongs to one of the most chal- lenging tasks in natural language processing .
The task of text summarization can be particularly important for decision making or relevance judgments ( Nenkova and McKeown , 2011 ) .
Automatic text summarization became very useful and also important tool to help the user obtain as much information as possible without the necessity to read all the original documents .
Many definitions of text summarization exist .
Text summary can be defined as a text produced from one or more texts that contains the same information as the original text and is no longer than half of the original text ( Hovy and Lin , 1998 ) .
Mani ( Mani , 2001 ) defined the goal of summarization as a process of finding the source of information , extracting content from it and presenting the most important content to the user in a concise form and in a manner sensitive to needs of user 's application .
We can divide techniques of summarization into two categories : abstractive and extractive summarization ( Gambhir and Gupta , 2017 ) .
Extractive summarization aims to choose parts of the original document such as sentence part , whole sentence or paragraph .
Abstractive summarization wants to get paraphrase content of the original document with respect to cohesion and concise of output summary .
Selection of the text section in extractive summarization leads to a partial loss of an output cohesion , which abstractive summarization tries to accomplish .
In last few years , approaches based on neural networks became very popular for summarization task ( Rush et al. , 2015 ) .
A specific branch of text summarization is a summarization of opinions from the human- generated text .
We can summarize opinions from customer reviews or comments on social networks .
This problem differs from a standard summarization task due to a number of repetitive and redundant information .
There can be also a problem with polarity of opinions be-tween different users .
This types of summary can be very useful for both a customer of products and a product owner .
Opinion summarization can be particularly important for decision making ( Yuan et al. , 2015 ) .
This summarization type can also show trends in opinions collected from comments on social networks , especially when a number of text entries grows very fast .
In this work , we also discuss analysis of specific aspect of opinion summarization : sentiment analysis of customer reviews .
In summarization task , sentiment information can be viewed as one of the inputs along with text corpora itself .
A difference between sentiment of text fragments and sentiment of whole summarization is a very interesting aspect to consider .
The expected contributions of our research are : ( 1 ) overview of a recent development in opinion summarization , ( 2 ) assembly of a reasonably big dataset for opinion summarization ( from travel based portals ) , ( 3 ) a novel method for opinion summarization based on state - of - the - art neural network architectures .
The rest of this paper is structured as follows .
Section 2 explains recent advances in text summarization .
In Section 3 , we focus on possibilities in the area of opinion mining and summarization of opinions .
Future directions in summarization are drawn in Section 4 .
The research proposal including opinion summarization along with a possible dataset and a planned experiment are described in Section 5 .
Final observations and conclusions are mentioned in Section 6 .
Text Summarization
In recent years , text summarization has been focusing on the abstractive summarization with a use of neural models .
In ( Rush et al. , 2015 ) , the authors showed a way to use a neural network based on encoder-decoder architecture for creating abstractive summarization on the sentence level .
Using this type of model originates from a task of machine translation where these models were used before .
The approach presented in ( Chopra et al. , 2016 ) can be considered as a follower of the previous work .
Instead of a feed-forward neural network a recurrent neural network ( RNN ) was used .
RNN emphasizes the order of input words .
The authors presented conditional RNN with convolutional attention - based encoder .
Ferreira et al. presented a sentence clustering algorithm to deal with the redundancy and information diversity problems ( Ferreira et al. , 2014 ) .
The algorithm uses the text representation to convert input text into graph model along with four types of relations between sentences .
A specific yet not very widely used technique is Abstract Meaning Representation ( AMR ) .
For text summarization , a framework for abstractive summarization based on the recent development of a treebank for AMR can be employed .
This framework parses source text into a set of AMR graphs , then the graph is transformed into a summary graph from which the output summary is generated .
The use of neural architecture from machine translation became widely popular and many authors made research in this area .
Nallapati et al .
( Nallapati et al. , 2016 ) presented a neural model for abstractive summarization along with the introduction of a whole new dataset for evaluation of summarization .
The use of attention mechanism in neural networks became widely spread and very popular .
Many works showed usefulness of this mechanism in other tasks .
In summarization task , a work proposed by See et al .
( See et al. , 2017 ) introduced a method based on the principle of encoderdecoder along with attention distribution of input text .
They used hybrid pointer - generator architecture with a use of the coverage .
The pointer mechanism tries to solve problem of choosing words either to use original word or generate a new one .
The coverage part ensures minimizing repetition during the text generation in the later parts of the output .
Interesting modification was introduced by Paulus et al .
( Paulus et al. , 2017 ) .
Their mechanism modifies standard attention mechanism and also objective function with a combination of maximum likelihood and cross-entropy loss .
This mechanism is used in a phase of reinforcement learning .
Tan et al .
( Tan et al. , 2017 ) proposed another modification of attention mechanism and their graph - based attention mechanism was used in a sequence - to-sequence framework .
The goal of the encoder is mapping the input documents to the vector representation .
Then decoder is used to generate the output sentences .
Novelty of their method lies in using graph - based attention mechanism in a hierarchical encoder-decoder framework .
Neural models are widely used for both abstrac-tive and extractive summarization .
Nallapati et al .
( Nallapati et al. , 2017 ) presented a neural sequential model for the extractive summarization of documents .
Visualizing impact of a particular parts of the input text to output summarization we can consider as other contribution of this paper .
Similarly to other tasks of natural language processing , convolutional neural networks can be used for summarization .
Yasunaga et al .
( Yasunaga et al. , 2017 ) incorporates sentence relations using Graph Convolutional Network on relation graphs along with the sentence embeddings obtained from RNN , which were taken as input node features .
This system tries to exploit a representational power of neural networks and sentence relation information which can be encoded in the graph representation of document clusters .
Much research has been conducted in this field in recent years .
Other interesting modification can employ latent structure modeling presented in a framework based on sequence - to-sequence oriented encoder-decoder model which incorporates a latent structure modeling component ( Li et al. , 2017 ) .
This model generates abstractive summary of the latent variables but also of the the discriminative deterministic states .
All aforementioned summarization works were primarily aimed at summarization of news articles .
There can be also other summarization types like a summarization of emails ( Carenini et al. , 2008 ; Yousefi-Azar and Hamey , 2017 ) , eventbased summarization ( Glava ? and ?najder , 2014 ; Kedzie et al. , 2015 ) , personalized summarization ( D?az and Gerv?s , 2007 ; Moro and Bielikova , 2012 ) and also sentiment - based or opinion summarization described in the next section .
Opinion Mining and Summarization Summarization of opinions is a special type of summarization .
Product and services along with comments on social networks could consist of hundreds of entries and could lead to information overload .
Repetition of opinions is one of the major differences that contrasts with the summarization of news .
User- generated text often remarkably differentiate from news text which is commonly widely revised .
Summarization of Customer Opinions Summarization of opinions from product reviews is the most common example of opinion summa-rization .
These reviews often come from stores of electronics like Amazon .
Yuan et al .
( Yuan et al. , 2015 ) presented user study how opinion summarization can help in decision making before consumer purchase .
One of the first works in opinion summarization could be considered the work of Hu and Liu ( Hu and Liu , 2004 ) .
They proposed a set of techniques for mining and summarizing product reviews .
The main goal of their opinion summarization system is to provide a feature - based summary .
Tadano et al. proposed method based on evaluative sentence extraction where aspects are judged by their ratings , tf - idf value and number of mentions with similar topic ( Tadano et al. , 2010 ) .
Summarization approach based on the topical structure was introduced by Zhan et al .
( Zhan et al. , 2009 ) .
They presented a topical structure as a list of significant topics related from a document set .
To reduce redundancy of sentences they implemented a method of maximal marginal relevance .
The Opinosis project presented a graph- based summarization framework ( Ganesan et al. , 2010 ) .
This framework tries to generate abstractive summarization of highly redundant opinions .
Authors showed that their summaries have better agreement with human summaries compared to the baseline extractive methods .
Dalal and Zaveri presented application of a multi-step approach for automatic opinion mining consisting of various phases ( Dalal and Zaveri , 2013 ) .
Authors showed that this multi-step feature - based semi-supervised opinion mining approach can be successful in identification of opinionated sentences from user reviews .
Aspect- based sentiment analysis can help to produce a structured summary based on positive and negative opinion about features of the product ( Kansal and Toshniwal , 2014 ) .
The system takes into consideration not only sentence information , but also pieces of information from other sentences or reviews called contextual information .
The authors also showed that polarity of words can be different even within one domain .
Kurian and Asokan presented a method with the cross-domain sentiment classification along with the distributional similarity of opinion words ( Kurian and Asokan , 2015 ) .
This method helps to classify and summarize product reviews and , in contrast with other methods , it does not require la-beled data from the target domain or other lexical resources .
Unlike other opinion summarization systems dealing with sentiment polarity , another study formulated opinion summarization as a community leader detection problem ( Zhu et al. , 2015 ) .
Authors proposed a graph- based method to identify informative sentences and evaluated method on product reviews .
The study proposed algorithms for leaders detection in the sentence graph .
A system named Gist ( Lovinger et al. , 2017 ) intends to deal with a large amount of text and automatically summarizes it into informative and actionable key sentences .
Gist tries to summarize original reviews into the short text consisting of a few key sentences that will capture the overall sentiment about the product .
A kind of opinion summarization could be a summarization of travel reviews to give feedback for quality of hotels , restaurants or other services .
A clustering based method for summarization of hotel reviews was proposed by Hu et al .
( Hu et al. , 2017 ) .
They also showed additional information as author 's reputation or creation date could have a huge impact on relevant summary creation .
Raut et al .
( Raut and Londhe , 2014 ) presented machine learning and Senti-WordNet method for mining opinions from hotel reviews and also a method for sentence relevant scoring .
Summarization of Community Answers Along with the summarization of customer reviews , a very important summarization type considers comments on social networks or answers in question answering ( QA ) systems as input entries .
Investigation in this forms of text entries can lead to easier decision making .
A sub-modular function - based framework was presented by Wang et al .
( Wang et al. , 2014 ) .
This framework can be used for query -focused opinion summarization .
Authors evaluated this framework in QA and blog dataset .
Statistically learned sentence relevance along with information coverage with respect to diverse topics are encoded as submodular functions .
Work of Lloret et al .
( Lloret et al. , 2015 ) deals both with the summarization of opinions in social networks and opinions in product reviews .
Their method can be characterized with an integration of sentence simplification , but also regeneration of sentence and also internal concept representation in the summarization task .
The method tries to be able to generate abstractive summaries .
There are many topics in this area which can lead to very interesting observations .
Guo et al .
( Guo et al. , 2015 ) proposed a model for opinion summarization of highly contrastive opinions particularly for controversial issues .
They integrated expert opinions with ordinary opinions to create an output of contrastive sentence pairs .
The study also presented this method as a unified way for users to better summarize opinions concerning controversial issues .
Another study explores opinion summarization of the spontaneous conversation ( Wang and Liu , 2015 ) .
Phone conversation corpus was annotated in this study and authors investigated two methods of extractive summarization , graph - based with incorporating topic and sentiment information and supervised method which cast this problem as a classification problem .
A study from Li et al. deals also with opinion summarization in blogging ( Li et al. , 2016 ) .
They proposed a convolutional neural network for opinion summarization based on recent deep-learning research .
Maximal marginal relevance is used for extraction of representative opinion sentences .
A very important problem of the volume and volatility of opinionated data published in social media was presented by Tsirakis et al .
( Tsirakis et al. , 2016 ) .
They discussed that most of methods deal only with a small volume of data , where they are quite effective , but usually do not scale up .
Future Directions
As presented in the previous sections , many challenges are still present in summarization .
Standard text summarization usually applied to news articles deals still with the problem of abstractive summarization .
Text summarization techniques can be on a different level of abstraction and usually are not fully abstractive ( See et al. , 2017 ) .
Another big challenge lies in summarization of text in languages other than English .
Most of methods were evaluated only on English and interesting could be an evaluation in other ones along with their specifics .
Another aspect could be summarization over multiple languages where input text does not need to be in only one language .
Summarization of user- generated content has to deal with a problem of the noisy and ungrammatical documents but also with very diverse and conflicting opinions included within these documents ( Murray et al. , 2017 ) .
This problem is even more protuberant in minor languages where opinion mining and sentiment analysis is not well developed ( Krchnavy and Simko , 2017 ) .
In opinion summarization with thousands of input entries a researcher should deal with a change of opinions during the time .
When summarizing customer reviews for services like hotels or restaurants , change of quality should be considered .
It can lead to a specific time - based summary which considers progress of opinions over the time .
This problem is also relevant in summarization of text in social networks , especially with controversial topics reports to the specific mood in society or can be effected by community leaders .
Lack of available large datasets for this task is other crucial subject of research in next years , since most of research was evaluated only on small ones .
A significant problem is present in the evaluation phase .
Automatic evaluation can be quite controversial as there exist not only one correct summarization .
Automatic evaluation measures like ROUGE and its modifications ( Lin , 2004 ) can partially deal with these problems using n-grams , but still do not handle a use of synonyms .
Same problems based on multiple formulation of ground truth can cause problems with human evaluation as well .
Experiments evaluated with more human participants have to deal with an agreement between users which can be quite low .
In next few years , we expect the opinion summarization to deal with the domain specifics and also with the user satisfaction .
The growth of usergenerated content in the future can lead to focus on reduction of information overload and also to text summarization itself .
Research Proposal
As we described earlier , we would like to focus on a specific type of summarization : creation of opinion summaries .
Nowadays , travel sites include thousands of reviews from users which visited one of reviewed places .
These reviews are very important in decision making of future possible customers but also for owners of services .
With tens of new reviews every day it is impossible to read all the reviews and it is often very difficult to choose only the relevant ones .
For owners , it is not possible to manually read all the reviews that could be very helpful in service improvement .
Recent advances in neural networks and also in the text summarization showed that employing encoder-decoder architecture can be very useful .
The problem of summarization of customer reviews differs from standard single document summarization where the models were applied before .
In this task , we should consider multi-modular framework .
The main idea of this proposal lies in getting better user satisfaction with review summary and also in examining of time aspect on opinion summarization .
Opinion summarization should process in several phases : 1 . aspect detection , 2 . clustering opinionated features , 3 . sentence generation .
The first step of our proposal lies in the detection of aspects .
Before creation of any summary , we need to identify aspects discussed in these reviews .
Another mechanism would be needed to distinguish similarity of aspects .
A taxonomy of aspects could be a very useful tool to avoid a separation of similar aspects but other approaches utilizing a distributional and vector space should be also examined .
We plan to use a bidirectional LSTM neural network with convolutional attention mechanism to identify aspects within text and also to determine polarity of each aspect .
In the second step , we have to cluster opinionated sentences by aspects they talk about .
In each cluster , a sentiment and polarity of opinions need to be determined .
Whereas in the task of sentiment analysis only overall or average sentiment is typically provided , in the summarization all polarity opinions should be included in the output summary .
To reach this goal , all the opinionated sentences and opinions should be identified .
In the final phase , we would like to employ neural network architecture to generate output sentences from collected aspect-oriented information .
In this phase , we need to generate sentence to output summary based on clustered aspects and also use the polarity of aspects .
We plan to use LSTM network for this stage and generate sentence from extracted aspects and their polarity .
There is also another important point of interest in task of summarization that has not been discussed yet .
The time horizon is often a neglected feature which should be considered in opinion summarization of customer reviews , as opinions of customers can develop over the time in a positive , but also a negative way .
We plan to include information about created time to process of clustering opinions along with other information about the reviewer , what can lead to better accuracy of summarization as well as resulting user satisfaction with an output summary .
Another significant point to discuss is employing end-to - end deep learning in the task of opinion summarization .
The major problem is lack of large dataset which is necessary for such learning .
Creation of this kind of dataset is expensive and could take hundreds of hours , if performed manually .
Dataset
To create an appropriate dataset , we plan to gather customer reviews from large travel portals ( e.g. , TripAdvisor , Booking.com ) .
All reviews come along with other useful information such as score ranking , which should be included too .
However any public information about reviewers could be very useful too as it shows reviewer relevance and also importance .
Experiments
To evaluate the quality of generated summaries a few experiments are required .
We will have to create our ground truth or reference summaries to automatically evaluate quality of summary .
As we mentioned before , it is not a sufficient way for evaluation and other experiments including human evaluation would be needed .
As this type of evaluation is very time consuming and difficult for resources , a posteriori evaluation is more feasible way to assess the quality of generated summaries .
Very interesting view for opinion summaries is comparison of the sentiment of generated summaries and the sentiment of original input reviews .
In human evaluation , we would like to provide users a list of original reviews , generated summary and ask about their satisfaction .
We also plan to use some other automatic measures like ROUGE ( Lin , 2004 ) and compare generated summary with summary created by humans .
Another important measure is aspect coverage and ratio of included aspect in generated summaries from original reviews .
Conclusion
In this paper , we described the background for summarization task .
More importantly , we described recent contributions and development in this area with many problems the research deals with .
We emphasized the main problems and future research directions in process of summarization and also particularly for opinion summarization .
We also introduced our future research intentions along with a design of the first experiments and possible model and dataset .
We demonstrated that summarization task and especially opinion summarization still have big open issues will be researched in the next few years .
