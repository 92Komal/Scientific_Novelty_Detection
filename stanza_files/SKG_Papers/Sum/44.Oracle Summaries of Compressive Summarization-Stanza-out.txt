Oracle Summaries of Compressive Summarization
abstract
This paper derives an Integer Linear Programming ( ILP ) formulation to obtain an oracle summary of the compressive summarization paradigm in terms of ROUGE .
The oracle summary is essential to reveal the upper bound performance of the paradigm .
Experimental results on the DUC dataset showed that ROUGE scores of compressive oracles are significantly higher than those of extractive oracles and state - of - the - art summarization systems .
These results reveal that compressive summarization is a promising paradigm and encourage us to continue with the research to produce informative summaries .
Introduction Compressive summarization , a joint model integrating sentence extraction and sentence compression within a unified framework , has been attracting attention in recent years ( Martins and Smith , 2009 ; Berg-Kirkpatrick et al. , 2011 ; Almeida and Martins , 2013 ; Qian and Liu , 2013 ; Kikuchi et al. , 2014 ; Yao et al. , 2015 ) .
Since compressive summarization methods can use a sub-sentence as an atomic unit , they can pack more information into summaries than extractive methods , which employ sentences as atomic units .
Thus , compressive summarization is essential when we want to produce summaries under tight length constraints .
There are two approaches to compress entire document ( s ) to be grammatical ; one is trimming the phrase structure trees ( Berg- Kirkpatrick et al. , 2011 ) and the other is trimming the dependency trees obtained from the document ( s ) ( Martins and Smith , 2009 ; Almeida and Martins , 2013 ; Qian and Liu , 2013 ; Kikuchi et al. , 2014 ; Yao et al. , 2015 ) .
This paper focuses on the latter approach because recently it has been receiving much attention .
To measure the performance of compressive summarization methods , ROUGE ( Lin , 2004 ) , an automatic evaluation metric , is widely used .
ROUGE evaluates a system summary by exploiting a set of human-made reference summaries to give a score in the range [ 0,1 ] .
When n-gram occurrences of the system summary agree with those in a set of reference summaries , the value is 1 .
However , system summaries cannot achieve ROUGE=1 since summarization systems cannot reproduce reference summaries in most cases .
In other words , the maximum ROUGE score that can be achieved by compressive summarization is unclear .
As a result , researchers cannot know how much room for further improvement is left .
Thus , it is beneficial to reveal the upper bound summary that achieves the maximum ROUGE score and can be produced by the systems .
The upper bound summary is known as the oracle summary .
To obtain the oracle summary on extractive summarization paradigms , several approaches have been proposed .
Sipos et al. ( 2012 ) utilized a greedy algorithm , and Kubina et al . ( 2013 ) utilized exhaustive search based on heuristics .
However , their oracle summaries do not always retain the optimal ( maximum ) ROUGE score .
Recently , Hirao et al. ( 2017 ) derived an Integer Linear Programming ( ILP ) formulation to obtain the optimal oracle summary .
Their oracle summary can help researchers to comprehend the strict limitation of the extractive summarization paradigm .
However , their method cannot be applied to obtain compressive oracle summaries .
To reveal the ultimate limitation of the compressive summarization paradigm , we propose an ILP formulation to obtain a compressive oracle summary that maximizes the ROUGE score .
We con-ducted experimental evaluation on the Document Understanding Conference ( DUC ) 2004 dataset .
The result demonstrated that ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries completely outperformed those of extractive oracle summaries and those of state - of - the - art summarization methods .
This indicates that compressive summarization is a promising paradigm for leveraging research resources .
Definition of Compressive Oracle Summaries
Before defining compressive oracle summary , we briefly describe ROUGE n .
Given K reference summaries R={R 1 , . . . , R K } and a system summary S. Let G={g n 1 , . . . , g n M } be the set of all n-grams appearing in reference summaries .
Let | G| =M . ROUGE n is defined as follows : ROUGE n ( R , S ) = K k=1 M j=1 min{N ( g n j , R k ) , N ( g n j , S ) } K k=1 M j=1 N ( g n j , R k ) ( 1 ) g n j represents the j-th n-gram appearing in reference summaries .
N ( g n j , R k ) and N ( g n j , S ) are the number of occurrences of n-gram g n j in R k and S , respectively .
Thus , compressive oracle summaries are defined as follows : O = arg max S?T ROUGE n ( R , S ) s.t. ( S ) ? L max . ( 2 ) T is the set of all valid word subsequences 1 obtained from sentences contained in the input document ( s ) , and L max is the length limitation of the oracle summary .
( S ) indicates the number of words in the summary .
Neither approximation nor exact algorithms are known for solving this problem .
ILP Formulation to Obtain the Compressive Oracle Summary
Dependency Structure of a Sentence
In this paper , we follow the dependency tree trimming approach proposed by Filippova et al . ( 2008 ; .
They proposed rules that transform a tree that represents dependency relation between 1 Word subsequences can be regarded as grammatical sentences .
We regard rooted subtrees of dependency trees as valid word subsequences .
For details , see Section 3.1. words into a tree that represents dependency relation between chunks ( consisting of a word or word sequence ) .
Since we can trim their dependency trees without loss of grammatical consistency , Thus , we employ the trees in our compressive summarization framework .
Figure 1 shows examples .
ILP Formulation maximize K k=1 M j=1 z k , j ( 3 ) s.t. | D| i=1 E i u=1 i , u b i , u ? L max ( 4 ) ?j : ? ?T ( g n j ) m ? ? z k , j ( 5 ) ?j : N ( g n j , R k ) ? z k , j ( 6 ) ?i , u : b i , parent ( i , u ) ? b i , u ( 7 ) ?i , v , q ?
V i ( w i , v ) : b i , q ? m i , v ( 8 ) ?i , v , p ?
U i ( w i , v ) : b i , p ? 1 ? m i , v ( 9 ) ?i , u : m i , v ? { 0 , 1 } ( 10 ) ?i , v : b i , u ? { 0 , 1 } ( 11 ) ?k , j : z k , j ? Z + . ( 12 )
Since the denominator of equation ( 1 ) is constant for a given set of reference summaries , we can find an oracle summary by maximizing the numerator of equation ( 1 ) .
Equation ( 3 ) is the objective function that corresponds to maximization of the numerator of equation ( 1 ) .
z k , j is the count of the j-th n-gram that is contained in both the k-th reference summary and the oracle summary .
Equation ( 4 ) ensures that the length of the oracle summary is less than L max . b i , u is a binary decision variable indicating whether u-th chunk in i-th sentence is contained in an oracle summary or not .
i , u indicates the number of the words in u-th chunk in the i-th sentence .
D is a set of sentences and E i is the number of chunks in the i-th sentence .
Equations ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) represent min operation in equation ( 1 ) .
w i , v is the v-th possible word sequence whose length is n and that is contained in the ith sentence , and m i , v is a binary decision variable indicating whether w i , v is contained in the oracle summary or not .
T ( g n j ) is a set of tuples consisting of indices ( i , v ) whose word sequence corresponds to g n j , i.e. , T ( g n j ) = { ( i , v ) |w i, v =g n j }.
Thus , z k , j = min{N ( g n j , R k ) , N ( g n j , S ) }.
Equation ( 7 ) ensures that an oracle summary consists w 2,1 : Some_dolphins , w 2,2 : dolphins_live , w 2,3 : dolphins_in , w 2,4 : dolphins_in , w 2,5 : live_in , w 2,6 : live_in , w 2,7 : rivers_in , w 2,8 : in_some , w 2,9 : some_regions . [ Most ] c1,1 [ dolphins ] c1,2 [ live ] c1,3 [ in every ocean . ]
c1,4 ROOT S 1 : [ Some dolphins ] c2,1 [ live ] c2,2 [ in rivers ] c2,3 [ in some regions . ]
c2,4 ROOT S 2 : [ Dolphins ] c3,1 [ usually ] c3,2 [ live ] c3,3 [ 20 - 40 years ] c3,4 [ in the wild . ]
Figure 1 : Examples of trees that represent dependency relations between chunks , and word sequences ( whose length is 2 ) .
Chunks are enclosed in square brackets .
Note that we disregard word sequences that are generated by destroying the structure of chunks such as " live every " in S 1 , " dolphins in " in S 2 , " live wild " in S 3 . of a set of rooted subtrees of the sentences in the entire document ( s ) .
Function parent ( i , u ) returns the index of the parent chunk of the u-th chunk in the dependency tree obtained from the i-th sentence .
Equations ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) represent the dependency relation between n-grams and chunks .
When we include w i , v in the oracle summary , we have to include all chunks that contain the words in w i , v .
In addition , when the above chunks have gap ( s ) , we have to drop chunk ( s ) within the gap ( s ) .
Here , V i ( w i , v ) is a set of indices of chunks that includes words in w i , v , and U i ( w i, v ) is a set of indices of chunks within the gap ( s ) , defined as { h| min( V i ( w i , v ) ) < h < max ( V i ( w i , v ) ) } and h / ? V i ( w i , v ) .
We give an example to show how chunks and word sequences are related .
When we pack a bigram " live in " in an oracle summary , there are four candidates in the source document ( Fig. 1 ) .
Word subsequences , w 1,6 , w 2,5 , w 2,6 and w 3.9 match " live in " .
Thus , T ( live in ) = { ( 1 , 6 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 3 , 9 ) } .
Here , when we want to pack w 2,6 into the oracle summary , we have to pack both chunks c 2,2 and c 2,4 ( b 2,2 = b 2,4 = 1 ) because U 2 ( w 2,6 ) = { 2 , 4 } . Then , we have to drop chunk c 2,3 ( b 2,3 = 0 ) because c 2,3 is within the gap between chunks c 2,2 and c 2,4 ( V 2 ( w 2,6 ) = 3 ) .
Similarly , when we pack w 3,9 into an oracle summary , we have to pack both chunks c 3,3 and c 3,5 and drop chunk c 3,4 .
However , this compres-sion is not allowed since there is no dependency relationship between c 3,3 and c 3,5 .
After solving the ILP problem , we can obtain compressive oracle summaries by collecting chunks according to b i , u = 1 .
Experiments
To investigate the potential limitation of the compressive summarization paradigm , we compare ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries with those of extractive oracle summaries and those obtained from state - of - the - art summarization systems .
Extractive oracle summaries are obtained by solving the ILP formulation proposed by ( Hirao et al. , 2017 ) .
System summaries are extracted from a public repository 2 .
Settings
We conducted experimental evaluation on the DUC - 2004 dataset for multiple document summarization evaluation , a widely used benchmark test set for generic multiple document summarization tasks .
The dataset consists of 50 topics , each of which contains 10 newspaper articles .
To obtain oracle summaries based on the ILP formulation described in section 3.2 , first , we applied the Stanford parser ( de Marneffe et al. , 2006 ) sentences in the dataset to obtain dependency relations between words , and then we transformed them into trees that represent the dependency relations between chunks by applying Filippova 's rules ( Filippova and Strube , 2008 ; Filippova and Altun , 2013 ) .
To solve the ILP problem , we utilized CPLEX version 12.5.1.0 .
We obtained and evaluated oracle summaries based on three variants of ROUGE , ROUGE 1 , ROUGE 2 and ROUGE - SU0 , with the following conditions 3 : ( 1 ) ROUGE 1 , utilizing unigrams excluding stopwords ( 2 ) ROUGE 2 , utilizing bigrams with stopwords , and ( 3 ) ROUGE - SU0 , which is an extension of ROUGE n , utilizing unigram and bigram ( excluding skip-bigram ) statistics .
Results and Discussion Table 1 shows ROUGE scores of compressive and extractive oracle summaries and those of RegSum ) that achieved the best ROUGE 1 and ICSISumm that achieved the best ROUGE 2 on the DUC - 2004 dataset , respectively .
We compare ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries with extractive oracle summaries .
The best scores are obtained when we use the same ROUGE variant for both computation and evaluation ( see bolded scores in Table 1 ) .
There are large differences between the best scores of ex -
As one of the reasons for the above results , compressive oracle summaries have a much larger number of ( sub - ) sentences than extractive oracle summaries for the same length limitation .
This is an advantage of compressive summarization over extractive summarization .
However , we have to note that compressive oracle summaries optimized to ROUGE 1 may not be desirable since they are produced by compressing sentences by ignoring contexts .
In fact , they obtained remarkable gain for ROUGE 1 score ( 8.3 points ) , while they obtained modest gains in ROUGE 2 and ROUGE - SU0 ( 0.7 and 3.6 points , respectively ) .
This may suggest that the resultant summaries overfit to the unigrams in the reference summaries .
We compare ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries with those of system summaries , ROUGE scores of compressive oracle summaries completely outperformed those of state - of - the - art systems .
The differences are in a range from 11 to 17 points .
The results demonstrated that compressive summarization is a promising approach to produce more informative summaries , and room still exists for further improvement .
Thus , compressive summarization is important research topic to leverage our resources .
Readability evaluation
We conducted human evaluation to compare readability of extractive oracle summaries to that of compressive oracle summaries .
We presented the oracle summaries to five human subjects and asked them to rate the summaries using an integer scale from 1 ( very poor ) to 5 ( very good ) .
Table 2 shows the results .
Extractive oracle summaries achieved near perfect scores .
Although the scores of compressive oracle summaries are inferior to those of extractive oracle summaries , they achieved good
