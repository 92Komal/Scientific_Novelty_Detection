Collective Personal Profile Summarization with Social Networks
abstract
Personal profile information on social media like LinkedIn.com and Facebook .com is at the core of many interesting applications , such as talent recommendation and contextual advertising .
However , personal profiles usually lack organization confronted with the large amount of available information .
Therefore , it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them .
In this paper , we address the task of personal profile summarization by leveraging both personal profile textual information and social networks .
Here , using social networks is motivated by the intuition that , people with similar academic , business or social connections ( e.g. co-major , co-university , and cocorporation ) tend to have similar experience and summaries .
To achieve the learning process , we propose a collective factor graph ( CoFG ) model to incorporate all these resources of knowledge to summarize personal profiles with local textual attribute functions and social connection factors .
Extensive evaluation on a large-scale dataset from LinkedIn .com demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach . *
Introduction Web 2.0 has empowered people to actively interact with each other , forming social networks around mutually interesting information and publishing a large amount of useful user- generated content ( UGC ) online ( Lappas et al. , 2011 ; Tan et al. , 2011 ) .
One popular and important type of UGC is the personal profile , where people post detailed *
Corresponding author information on online portals about their education , experiences and other personal information .
Social websites like Facebook.com and LinkedIn.com have created a viable business as profile portals , with the popularity and success partially attributed to their comprehensive personal profiles .
Generally , online personal profiles provide valuable resources for businesses , especially for human resource managers to find talents , and help people connect with others of similar backgrounds ( Yang et al. , 2011a ; Guy et al. , 2010 ) .
However , as there is always large-scale information of experience and education fields , it is hardly for us to find useful information from the profile .
Therefore , it is always a challenge for people to find desired information from them .
For this regard , it is highly desirable to develop reliable methods to generate a summary of a person through his profile automatically .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first research that explores automatic summarization of personal profiles in social media .
A straightforward approach is to consider personal profile summarization as a traditional document summarization problem , which treating each personal profile independently and generate a summary for each personal profile individually .
For example , the well -known extraction and ranking approaches ( e.g. PageRank , HITS ) extract a certain amount of important sentences from a document according to some ranking measurements to form a summary ( Wan and Yang , 2008 ; Wan , 2011 ) .
However , such straightforward approaches are not sufficient to benefit from the carrier of personal profiles .
As the centroid of social networking , people are usually connected to others with similar background in social media ( e.g. co-major , cocorporation ) .
Therefore , it is reasonable to leverage social connection to improve the performance of profile summarizing .
For example if there are co-major , co-university , co-corporation or other academic and business relationships between two persons , we consider them sharing similar experience and having similar summaries .
The remaining challenge is how to incorporate both the profile textual information and the connection knowledge in the social networks .
In this study , we propose a collective factor graph model ( CoFG ) to summarize the text of personal profile in social networks with local textual information and social connection information .
The CoFG framework utilizes both the local textual attribute functions of an individual person and the social connection factor between different persons to collectively summarize personal profile on one person .
In this study , we treat the profile summarization as a supervised learning task .
Specifically , we model each sentence of the profile as a vector .
In the training phase , we use the vectors with the social connection between each person to build the CoFG model ; while in the testing phase , we perform collective inference for the importance of each sentence and select a subset of sentences as the summary according to the trained model .
Evaluation on a large-scale data from LinkedIn .com indicates that our proposed joint model and social connection information improve the performance of profile summarization .
The remainder of our paper is structured as follows .
We go over the related work in Section 2 .
In Section 3 , we introduce the data we collected from LinkedIn.com and the annotated corpus we constructed .
In Section 4 , we present some motivational analysis .
In Section 5 , we explain our proposed model and describe algorithms for parameter estimation and prediction .
In Section 6 , we present our experimental results .
We sum up our work and discuss future directions in Section 7 .
Related Work
In this section , we will introduce the related work on the traditional topic-based summarization , social - based summarization and factor graph model respectively .
Topic- based Summarization Generally , traditional topic-based summarization can be categorized into two categories : extractive ( Radev et al. , 2004 ) and abstractive ( Radev and McKeown , 1998 ) summarization .
The former selects a subset of sentences from original document ( s ) to form a summary ; the latter reorganizes some sentences to form a summary where several complex technologies , such as information fusion , sentence compression and reformulation are necessarily employed ( Wan and Yang , 2008 ; Celikyilmaz and Hakkani- Tur , 2011 ; Wang and Zhou , 2012 ) .
This study focuses on extractive summarization .
Radev et al. ( 2004 ) proposed a centroid-based method to rank the sentences in a document set , using various kinds of features , such as the cluster centroid , position and TF - IDF features .
Ryang and Abekawa ( 2012 ) proposed a reinforcement learning approach on text summarization , which models the summarization within a reinforcement learning - based framework .
Compared to unsupervised approaches , supervised learning for summarization is relatively rare .
A typical work is Shen et al. , ( 2007 ) which present a Conditional Random Fields ( CRF ) based framework to treat the summarization task as a sequence labeling problem .
However , different from all existing studies , our work is the first attempt to consider both textual information and social relationship information for supervised summarization .
Social - based Summarization
As web 2.0 has empowered people to actively interact with each other , studies focusing on social media have attracted much attention recently ( Meeder et al. , 2011 ; Rosenthal and McKeown , 2011 ; Yang et al. , 2011a ) .
Social - based summarization is exactly a special case of summarization where the social connection is employed to help obtaining the summarization .
Although topicbased summarization has been extensively studied , studies on social - based summarization are relative new and rare .
Hu et al. , ( 2011 ) proposed an unsupervised Pag-eRank - based social summarization approach by incorporating both document context and user context in the sentence evaluation process .
Meng et al. , ( 2012 ) proposed a unified optimization framework to produce opinion summaries of tweets through integrating information from dimensions of topic , opinion and insight , as well as other factors ( e.g. topic relevancy , redundancy and language styles ) .
Unlike all the above studies , this paper focuses on a novel task , profile summarization .
Furthermore , we employ many other kinds of social information in profiles , such as co-major , and cocorporation between two people .
They are shown to be very effective for profile summarization .
Factor Graph Model
As social network has been investigated for several years ( Leskovec et al. , 2010 ; Tan et al. , 2011 ; Lu et al. , 2010 ; Guy et al. , 2010 ) and Factor Graph Model ( FGM ) is a popular approach to describe the relationship of social network ( Tang et al. , 2011a ; Zhuang et al. , 2012 ) . Factor Graph Model builds a graph to represent the relationship of nodes on the social networks , and the factor functions are always considered to represent the relationship of the nodes .
Tang et al. ( 2011a ) and Zhuang et al . ( 2012 ) formalized the problem of social relationship learning into a semi-supervised framework , and proposed Partially - labeled Pairwise Factor Graph Model ( PLP - FGM ) for learning to infer the type of social ties .
Dong et al. ( 2012 ) gave a formal definition of link recommendation across heterogeneous networks , and proposed a ranking factor graph model ( RFG ) for predicting links in social networks , which effectively improves the predictive performance .
Yang et al. , ( 2011 b ) generated summaries by modeling tweets and social contexts into a dual wing factor graph ( DWFG ) , which utilized the mutual reinforcement between Web documents and their associated social contexts .
Different from all above researches , this paper proposes a pair-wise factor graph model to collectively utilize both textual information and social connection factor to generate summary of profile .
Data Collection and Statistics
The personal profile summarization is a novel task and there exists no related data for accessing this issue .
Therefore , in this study , we collect a data set containing personal summaries with the corresponding knowledge , such as the self-introduction and personal profiles .
In this section , we will introduce this data set in detail .
Data Collection
We collect our data set from LinkedIn.com 1 . It contains a large number of personal profiles generated by users , containing various kinds of information , such as personal overview , summary , education , experience , projects and skills .

In this study , the data set is crawled in the following ways .
To begin with , 10 random people 's public profiles are selected as seed profiles , and then the profiles from their " People Also Viewed " field were collected .
The data is composed of 3,182 public profiles 3 in total .
We do not collect personal names in public profiles to protect people 's privacy .
Figure 1 shows an example of a person 's profile from LinkedIn.com .
background .
Among these fields , the Overview is required and the others are optional , such as Project , Course and Interest groups .
However , compared with Overview , Summary , Experience , Education fields , they seem to be less important for summarization of personal profiles .
Thus , we ignore them in our study .
Data Statistics of Major Fields
We collected 3,182 personal profiles from LinkedIn.com .
Table 1 shows the statistics of major fields in our data collection .
Field
Corpus Construction and Annotation Among the 921 profiles that contain the summary , we manually select 497 profiles with high quality summary to construct the corpus for our research .
These high-quality summaries are all written by the authors themselves .
Here , the quality is measured by manually checking that whether they are well capable of summarizing their profiles .
That is , they are written carefully , and could give an overview of a person and represent the education and experience information of a person .
After carefully seeing the profiles , we observe that the Experience field contains the most abundant information of a person .
Thus , we treat the text of Experience field as the source of summary for each profile .
Besides , we collect social context information from Education and Experience field , and these social contexts are including by Linked In explicitly .
Table 2 shows the average length of summary and experience fields we used for evaluating our summarization approach .
Field Average length Summary ( the summary of the profile ) 37.2 Experience ( the source text for the summarizing ) 372.0
Motivation and Analysis
In this section , we propose the motivation of social connection to address the task of personal profile summarization .
To preliminarily support the motivation , some statistics of the social connection are provided .
We first describe the social connections which we used .
Figure 2 shows an example of social connection between people from the profiles of LinkedIn .
We find that people are sometimes connected by several social connections .
For example , John and Lucy are connected by co_unvi relationship , while Lily and Linda are connected by co_corp relationship .
From LinkedIn , four kinds of social relationship between people are extracted from the Education field and Experience field .
They are : ? co_major denotes that two persons have the same major at school ?
co_univ denotes that two persons are graduated from the same university ?
co_title denotes that two persons have the same title at corporation .
? co_corp denotes that two persons work at the same corporation .
Our basic motivation of using social connection lies in the fact that " connected " people will tend to hold related experience and similar summaries .
We then give the statistics of edges of social connection .
Table 3 shows basic statistics across these edges .
From Table 3 , we can see that the number of users is 497 while the number of social connection edges is 14,307 .
The latter is much larger than the former .
The number of the edges from Education field is similar with the number of the edges from Experience filed .
Among all the relationships , co_unvi is the most common one .

Collective Factor Graph Model
In this section , we propose a collective factor graph ( CoFG ) model for learning and summarizing the text of personal profile with local textual information and social connection .
Overview of Our Framework
To generate summaries for profiles , a straightforward approach is to treat each personal profile independently and generating a summary for each personal profile individually .
As we mentioned on Section 3.3 , we use the sentences of Experience field as a text document and consider it as the source of summary for each profile .
Instead , we formalize the problem of personal profile summarization in a pair-wise factor graph model and propose an approach referred to as Loopy Belief Propagation algorithm to learn the model for generating the summary of the profile .
Our basic idea is to define the correlations using different types of factor functions .
An objective function is defined based on the joint probability of the factor functions .
Thus , the problem of collective personal profile summarization model learning is cast as learning model parameters that maximizes the joint probability of the input continuous dynamic network .
The overview of the proposed method is a supervised framework ( as shown in Figure 3 ) .
agation algorithm to learn the model and predict the sentences of testing data ; finally , we select a subset of sentences of each testing profile as the summary according to the models with top -n prediction score .
Thus , the core issues of our framework are 1 ) how to define the collective factor graph model to connection profiles with social connection ; 2 ) how to learn and predict the proposed CoFG model ; 3 ) how to predict the sentences from the testing data with the proposed CoFG model , and generate the summary by the predict scores .
We will discuss these issues on the following subsections .
Model Definition Formally , given a network ( , , , )
LU G V S S X ? , each sentence i s is associated with an attribute vector i x of the profile and a label i y indicating whether the sentence is selected as a summary of the profile ( The value of i y is binary .
1 means that the sentence is selected as a summary sentence , whereas 0 stands for the opposite ) .
V denotes the authors of the profiles , L S denotes the labeled training data , and U S denotes the unlabeled testing data .
Let {} i Xx ? and i Yy ? .
Then , we have the following formulation ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , | | , , P X G Y P Y P Y X G P X G ? ( 1 ) Here , G denotes all forms of network information .
This probabilistic formulation indicates that labels of skills depend on not only local attributes X , but also the structure of the network G. According to Bayes ' rule , we have ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , | | , , | | P X G Y P Y P Y X G P X G P X Y P Y G ? ? ( 2 ) Where ( | ) P Y G represents the probability of labels given the structure of the network and ( | ) P X Y denotes the probability of generating attributes X associated to their labels Y .
We assume that the generative probability of attributes given the label of each edge is conditionally independent , thus we have ? ? ? ? ? ? | , | | ii i P Y X G P Y G P x y ? ? ( 3 )
Where ( | ) ii P x y is the probability of generating attributes i x given the label i y .
Now , the problem becomes how to instantiate the probability ( | ) P Y G and ( | ) ii P x y .
We model them in a Markov random field , and thus according to the Hammersley - Clifford theorem ( Hammersley and Clifford , 1971 ) , the two probabilities can be instantiated as follows : ? ? ? ?
1 1 1 | exp , d i i j j ij i j P x y f x y Z ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( 4 ) ? ? ? ? () 2 1 | exp , i j NB i P Y G g i j Z ? ? ? ? ? ? ( 5 ) Where 12 and ZZ are normalization factors .
Eq. 4 indicates that we define an attribute function ( , ) ii f x y for each attribute ij x associated with sentence i s . j ? is the weight of the j th attribute .
Eq. 5 represents that we define a set of correlation facfunctions ( , ) g i j over each pair ( , ) ij in the network . ( ) NB i denotes the set of social relationship neighbors nodes of i. Local textual attribute functions { ( , ) } ij i j f x y :
It denotes the attribute value associated with each sentence i .
We define the local textual attribute as a feature ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ) .
We can accumulate all the attribute functions and obtain local entropy for a person : ? ?
1 1 exp , k k ik i ik f x y Z ? ? ? ? ? ( 6 ) The textual attributes include following features ( Shen et al. , 2007 ; Yang et al. , 2011 b ) : 1 ) BOW : the bag-of-words of each sentence , we use unigram features as the basic textual features for each sentence .
2 ) Length : the number of terms of each sentence .
3 ) Topic_words : these are the most frequent words in the sentence after the stop words are removed .
4 ) PageRank_scores : as shown in the related work section , a document can be treated as a graph and applying a graph - based ranking algorithm ( Wan and Yang. , 2008 ) .
We thus use the PageRank score to reflect the importance of each sentence .
Social connection factor function ( , ) ij g y y :
For the social correlation factor function , we define it through the pairwise network structure .
That is , if the person of sentence i and the person of sentence j have a social relationship , a factor function for this social connection is defined ( Tang et al. , 2011a ; Tang et al. , 2011 b ) , i.e. , ? ? ? ? ? ?
2 , exp i j ij i j g y y y y ? ? ( 7 ) The person-person social relationships are defined on Section 4 , e.g. co_major , co_univ , co_title , and co_corp .
We define that if two persons have at least one social connection edge , they have a social relationship .
In addition , ij ? is the weight of the function , representing the influence degree of i on j .
To better understand our model , one example of factor decomposition is given in Figure 4 .
In this example , there are six sentences from three profiles .
Among them , four sentences are labeled ( two are labeled with the category of " 1 " , i.e , 1 y ? and the other two are labeled with the category of " 0 ' , i.e. , 0 y ? ) and two sentences are unlabeled ( they are represented by y= ? ) .
We have six attribute functions .
For example , 1 ( , ) i f v y denotes the set of local textual attribute functions of i y .
We also have five pairwise relationships ( e.g. , 24 ( , ) yy , 35 ( , ) yy ) based on the structure of the input personal profile social network .
For example , 35 ( , ) g y y denotes social connection between 3 y and 5 y , while they share the co_major relationship on the left figure .
Model Learning
We now address the problem of estimating the free parameters .
The objective of learning the CoFG model is to estimate a parameter configuration ( { } , { } ) ? ? ? ? to maximize the log-likelihood ob- jective function ( ) log ( | , ) L P Y X G ? ? ? , i.e. ,
? ? * arg max L ? ? ( 9 ) To solve the objective function , we adopt a gradient descent method .
We use ?
( the weight of the social connection factor function ( , ) ij g y y ) as the example to explain how we learn the parameters ( the algorithm also applies to tune ? by simply replacing ? with ? ) .
Specifically , we first write the gradient of each k ? with regard to the objective function ( Eq. 9 ) : ? ? ? ? ? ? ( | , ) , , k P Y X G k L E g i j E g i j ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ( 10 ) Where [ ( , ) ]
E g i j is the expectation of factor function ( , ) g i j given the data distribution ( essentially it can be considered as the average value of the factor function ( , ) g i j over all pair in the training data ) ; and ( | , ) [ ( , ) ]
k Y X G P E g i j ? is the expectation of factor function ( , ) g i j under the distribution ( | , ) k P Y X G ? given by the estimated model .
A similar gradient can be derived for parameter j a .
We approximate the marginal distribution ( | , ) [ ( , ) ]
k Y X G P E g i j ? using LBP ( Tang et al. , 2011 ; Zhuang et al. , 2012 ) .
With the marginal probabilities , the gradient can be obtained by summing over all triads .
It is worth noting that we need to perform the LBP process twice for each iteration : one is to estimate the marginal distribution of unknown variables ?
i y ? and the other is to estimate the marginal distribution over all pairs .
In this way , the algorithm essentially performs a transfer learn-ing over the complete network .
Finally , with the obtained gradient , we update each parameter with a learning rate ? .
The learning algorithm is summarized in Figure 5 . Input : Network G ,
Model Prediction and Summary Generated
We can see that in the learning process , the learning algorithm uses an additional loopy belief propagation to infer the label of unknown relationships .
With the estimated parameter ? , the summarization process is to find the most likely configuration of Y for a given profile .
This can be obtained by ? ? * arg max | , , Y L Y X G ? ? ( 11 ) Finally , we select a subset of sentences of each testing profile as the summary according to the trained models with top -n prediction scores by * Y ( Tang et al. , 2011 b ; Dong et al , 2012 ) .
Experimentation
In this section , we describe the settings of our experiment and present the experimental results of our proposed CoFG model .
Experiment Settings
In the experiment , we use the corpus collected from LinkedIn .
com that contains 497 profiles ( see more details in Section 3 ) .
The existing summaries in these profiles are served as the reference summary ( the standard answers ) .
As discussed in subsection 3.3 , the average length of summary is about 40 words .
Thus , we extract 40 words to construct the summary for each profile .
We use 200 personal profiles as the testing data , and the remaining ones as the training data .
We use the ROUGE -1.5.5 ( Lin and Hovy , 2004 ) toolkit for evaluation , a popular tool that has been widely adopted by several evaluations such as DUC and TAC ( Wan and Yang , 2008 ; Wan , 2011 ) .
We provide four of the ROUGE F-measure scores in the experimental results : ROUGE - 2 ( bigrambased ) , ROUGE -L ( based on longest common subsequences ) , ROUGE -W ( based on weighted longest common subsequence , weight = 1.2 ) , and ROUGE - SU4 ( based on skip bigram with a maximum skip distance of 4 ) .
Experimental Results
We compare the proposed CoFG approach with three baselines illustrated as follows : ? Random : we randomly select sentences of each profile to generate the summary for the profile .
? HITS : we employ the HITS algorithm to perform profile summarization ( Wan and Yang , 2008 ) .
In detail , we first consider the words as hubs the sentences as authorities ;
Then , we rank the sentences with the authorities ' scores for each profile individually ;
Finally , the highest ranked sentences are chosen to constitute the summary .
?
PageRank : we employ the PageRank algorithm to perform profile summarization ( Wan and Yang , 2008 ) .
In detail , we first connect the sentences of the profile with cosine text - based similar measure to construct a graph ;
Then , we apply PageRank algorithm to rank the sentence through the graph for each profile individually ;
Finally , the highest ranked sentences are chosen to constitute the summary .
?
MaxEnt : as a supervised learning approach , maximum entropy uses textual attribute as features to train a classification model .
Then , the classification model is employed to predict which sentences can be selected to generate the summary .
For the implementation of MaxEnt , we employ the tool of mallent toolkits 4 . Table 4 shows the comparison results of our approach ( CoFG ) and the baseline approaches .
From Table 4 , we can see that 1 ) either HITS or Pag-eRank outperforms the approach of random selection ; 2 ) The supervised approach i.e.
MaxEnt , outperforms both the HITS algorithm and the Pag-eRank approach ; 3 ) CoFG model performs best and it greatly outperforms both the unsupervised and supervised learning baseline approaches in terms of the ROUGE - 2 F-measure score .
This result verifies the effectiveness of considering the social connection between the sentences in different profiles , Figure 6 shows the performance of our proposed CoFG model with different sizes of training data .
From Figure 6 , we can see that CoFG model with social connection always performs better than MaxEnt , and the performance of our approach descends slowly when the training dataset becomes small .
Specifically , the performance of CoFG using only 10 % training data achieves better performance than MaxEnt using 100 % training data .
From Table 5 , we can see that all of our proposed approaches , i.e. , CoFG -edu , CoFG -exp , and CoFG , outperform the baseline approach , i.e. , MaxEnt .
However , the performance of CoFG -edu , CoFG -exp and CoFG are similar .
This result is mainly due to the fact that the information of social connection is redundant .
For example , two persons who are connected by co_major ( education field ) might also be connected by co_corp ( experience field ) .
Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper , we present a novel task named profile summarization and propose a novel approach called collective factor graph model to address this task .
One distinguishing feature of the proposed approach lies in its incorporating the social con-nection .
Empirical studies demonstrate that the social connection is effective for profile summarization , which enables our approach outperform some competitive supervised and unsupervised baselines .
The main contribution of this paper is to explore social context information to help generate the summary of the profiles , which represents an interesting research direction in social network mining .
In the future work , we will explore more kinds of social context information and investigate better ways of incorporating them into profile summarization and a wider range of social network mining .
