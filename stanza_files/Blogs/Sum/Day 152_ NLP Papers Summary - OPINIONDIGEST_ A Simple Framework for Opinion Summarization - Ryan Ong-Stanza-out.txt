Day 152 : NLP Papers Summary - OPINIONDIGEST : A Simple Framework For Opinion Summarization
abstract
Objective and Contribution Presented OPINIONDIGEST , an abstractive opinion summarisation framework that uses Aspect- based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) to extract opinion phrases from reviews and trains a Transformer to reconstruct the original reviews from these extracted opinion phrases .
We merge opinion phrases from multiple reviews and select the most popular ones at summarisation time .
OPINIONDIGEST can also generate summaries based on different user needs , by ltering selected opinion based on the user 's aspect and / or sentiment .
We show that ?

our model was able to outperformed other baseline models and produces informative customisable summaries .
OPINIONDIGEST Framework
For each entity , our goal is to generate abstractive summaries of the most salient opinions in the relevant reviews .
OPINIONDIGEST has three main components : 1 . Opinion Extraction
Controllable Opinion Selection
Summary Generation
OPINION EXTRACTION
Here , we used a pre-trained tagging model to obtain our opinion set that contains extracted opinion phrases and its respective polarity and aspect categories .
OPINION SELECTION
For each review that contains the entity , we want to extract the entity 's opinion set .
Summarising the opinion sets of each entity involves
SUMMARY GENERATION
Here , our goal is to reconstruct reviews from our extracted opinion phrases and generate opinion summaries from our selected opinions .
We train our transformer model by encoding extracted opinion phrases of a single review and learning to reconstruct the review 's full text .
We then used the trained transformer to generate summaries .
During summarisation , we would use the selected opinions ( concatenated together ) as an input to our trained transformer model to generate the respective summary .
Experiments and Results We
RESULTS
The The results are showcase in the table 2 below and OPINIONDIGEST 's summaries scored the highest in both informativeness and coherence , however , the summaries still need to work on reduce redundancy .
We also performed content support study where judges were given 8 input reviews from YELP , and are required to evaluate the extent to which each sentence is supported by the reviews .
selecting the most salient opinions .
Here , we have three operations : opinion merging , ranking , and ltering ( optional ) .
Opinion merging is where we used greedy algorithm and word embeddings to merge similar opinions ( measured using cosine similarity ) into different clusters .
We would then rank these clusters ( opinion ranking ) based on size where we assume the larger a cluster is , the more popular the opinions ? ? 21/02/2022 , 21:42 Day 152 : NLP Papers Summary - OPINIONDIGEST : A Simple Framework for Opinion Summarization - Ryan ?

The last operation is opinion ltering ( optional ) where we control the selection process by ltering opinions based on aspect category or sentiment .
have to evaluation datasets : YELP restaurant reviews and HOTEL reviews .
The YELP dataset has 624 K training reviews whereas the HOTEL has 688K reviews .
Our evaluation metrics are ROUGE - 1 , - 2 , and - L . We have 3 baseline models : LexRank , MeanSum , and the Best / Worst Review ( the highest / lowest average word overlap with input reviews ) .
results above on the YELP dataset shows that our framework outperformed all the baseline models .
Our framework is not an unsupervised model but we only required labelled data for our opinion extractor model .
To further evaluate our framework , we conducted human evaluation to evaluate the quality of our generated summaries .
Judges are asked to evaluate the summary based on three criteria : Papers Summary - OPINIONDIGEST : A Simple Framework for Opinion Summarization - Ryan ?

Table 3 below showcase the proportion of sentences in the summary that are fully , partially and not supported by the input reviews .
We show that OPINIONDIGEST was able to generate summaries that have a higher proportion of fully and partially supported sentences .
Lastly , we want to measure how well our framework can generate summaries based on different aspects .
We produced aspect-speci c summaries and asked the participants to evaluate if the summaries includes the speci ed aspects exclusively , partially , or not at all .

https://ryanong.co.uk/2020/05/31/day-152-nlp-papers-summary-opiniondigest-a-simple-framework-for-opinion-summarization/ 5/9
results are displayed below and we show that OPINIONDIGEST can generate summaries that are exclusively or partially related to speci ed aspects 89.7 % of the time .
QUALITATIVE OUTPUT
Below are example summaries that showcase OPINIONDIGEST 's ability to summaries more 100 + reviews and also how we can control the summaries using opinion ltering of aspects and sentiments .
The rst two examples showcase the ability of our model to generate summaries based on 8 and 128 reviews .
Our framework does n't aggregate review representations and so the scalability of our model is not tied down to the input size .
Example 3 - 6 showcase how we can control the generated summaries using aspects and sentiments .
Example 3 - 4 control the generated summaries using sentiments whereas Example 5 - 6 uses different aspects ( staff vs food ) .
