abstract
Citation text are texts that highlight contributions of the referenced paper .
Existing work has shown that citation text are useful for many downstream tasks such as search and summarisation .
The problem with citation text is that it often lacks context such as methodology , assumptions or conditions for the obtained results .
Contextualising Citations
Our approach extends language models by incorporating word embeddings and domain ontology .
The purpose of the language model is to rank a document ( reference spans ) according to the query ( the citation text ) .
We used embeddings to score documents that are semantically similar to the chosen query .
We also used domain ontologies to capture information that might not be included in the embeddings .
The domain ontologies can extend the embedding based language models as follows :
Results
INTRINSIC EVALUATION
The results are displayed in the table 1 below .
As shown , our model of biomedical embeddings with domain knowledge interpolation achieved the best performance in most of the evaluation metrics .
This indicates that our models are effective in many different aspects .
We found that general embedding does not provide much advantage when compared to the best performing baseline model .
However , when we used the domain-speci c embeddings , we observed a 10 % c-F improvement over the best performing baseline model .
This is as expected as the biomedical embeddings are better at capturing the word relations in biomedical context .
This is illustrated by table 2 where we showcase top relevant words for the word " expression " provided by the two types of embeddings .
The last two rows of table 1 showcase the bene t of including domain ontologies and we found that interpolation yielded a stronger improvement than retro tting .

4/9
Our models also correlate well with human annotations .
As shown in table 3 below , when the human precision is high ( upper quartiles ) , our system performs better in c-F metric with higher con dence ( lower standard deviation ) .
EXTERNAL EVALUATION
Citation 1 . Retro tting .
We used MESH and Protein Ontologies ( PO ) to modify word embeddings and pull synonymous words closer together 2 .
Interpolating .
We directly modi ed the language model and incorporate the performance of training using the Wikipedia embeddings and biomedical embeddings .
In addition , we also compare the performance of biomedical embeddings with retro tting and with interpolating domain knowledge .
In terms of evaluation metrics on the quality of extracted citation contexts ( intrinsic evaluation ) , we have evaluation metrics for assessing the quality of retrieved contexts for each citation from multiple aspects : ? ? 21/02/2022 , 21:35 Day 186 : NLP Papers Summary - Contextualizing Citations for Scientific Summarization using Word Embed ?

3/9 1 . Character offset overlaps between retrieved contexts and human annotations in terms of precision , recall , and F-score 2 .
nDCG scores where we treat any partial overlaps with the goal standard as correct context 3 . ROUGE -N scores to measure content similarity between retrieved contexts and gold standard 4 . Character precision at K
- based summarisation can effectively capture different contributions and aspects of a research paper by using the citation texts .
Here , we compare the summarisation quality between no contextualisation and our proposed contextualisation approaches .
We have multiple baseline models and our evaluation metric is ROUGE scores : displayed below .
The " No context " showcase the performance of all summarisation approach on solely the citations and without any context .
All the other rows are different summarisation algorithms on citation text with our contextualisation methods .

5/9 Ryan Data Scientist best performing model is biomedical embeddings with domain knowledge interpolation , which signi cantly improves the quality of summaries in terms of ROUGE scores .
This showcase that the intrinsic quality of citation contextualisation has a direct impact on the end -
