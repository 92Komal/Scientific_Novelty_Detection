abstract
Introduction
The paper presents a suite of benchmark tasks to evaluate end-to - end dialogue systems such that performing well on the tasks is a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for a fully functional dialogue agent .

Dataset
Tasks
QA Task Answering Factoid Questions without relation to the previous dialogue .
KB ( Knowledge Base ) created using OMDB and stored as triplets of the form ( Entity , Relation , Entity ) .
Question ( in Natural Language Form ) generated by creating templates using
SimpleQuestions
Instead of giving out just 1 response , the system ranks all the answers in order of their relevance .
Recommendation Task Providing personalised responses to the user via recommendation instead of providing universal facts as in case 1 .
MovieLens dataset with a user x item matrix of ratings .
Statements ( for any user ) are generated by sampling highly ranked movies by the user and forming a statement about these movies using natural language templates .
Like the previous case , a list of ranked responses is generated .
QA + Recommendation Task Maintaining short dialogues involving both factoid and personalised content .
Dataset consists of short conversations of 3 exchanges ( 3 from each participant ) .
Reddit Discussion Task Identify most likely response is discussions on Reddit .
Data processed to flatten the potential conversation so that it appears to be a two participant conversation .
Joint Task Combines all the previous tasks into one single task to test all the skills at once .
Models Tested Memory Networks
- Comprises of a memory component that includes both long term memory and short term context .
Supervised Embedding Models
- Sum the word embeddings of the input and the target independently and compare them with a similarity metric .
Recurrent Language Models - RNN , LSTM , SeqToSeq Question Answering Systems
- Systems that answer natural language questions by converting them into search queries over a KB .
Joint Task Supervised word embeddings perform very poorly even when using a large number of dimensions ( 2000 dimensions ) .
Memory Networks perform better than embedding models as they can utilise the local context and the long-term memory .
But they do not perform as well on standalone QA tasks .
Created using large-scale real-world sources - OMDB ( Open Movie Database ) , MovieLens and Reddit .
Consists of ~75 K movie entities and ~ 3.5 M training examples .
