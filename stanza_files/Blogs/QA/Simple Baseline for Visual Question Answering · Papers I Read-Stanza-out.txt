Simple Baseline for Visual Question Answering
abstract
Problem Statement VQA
Task : Given an image and a free-form , openended , natural language question ( about the image ) , produce the answer for the image .
The paper attempts to ne tune the simple baseline method of Bag-of-Words + Image features ( iBOWIMG ) to make it competitive against more sophisticated LSTM models .
Link to the paper
Model VQA modelled as a classi cation task where the system learns to choose among one of the top k most prominent answers .
Text Features - Convert input question to a one-hot vector and then transform to word vectors using a word embedding .
Image Features - Last layer activations from
GoogLeNet .
Text features are concatenated with image features and fed into a softmax .
Different learning rates and weight clipping for word embedding layer and softmax layer with the learning rate for embedding layer much higher than that of softmax layer .
Results iBOWIMG model reports an accuracy of 55.89 % for Open-ended questions and 61.97 % for Multiple - Choice questions which is comparable to the performance of other , more sophisticated models .
While the results reported by the paper are not themselves so signi cant , the described approach provides a way to interpret the strengths and weakness of different VQA datasets .

This is the greatest strength of the paper even though the model is very simple and naive .
The model attempts to memorise the correlation between the answer class and the informative words ( in the question ) and image features .
Question words generally can in uence the answer given the bias in images occurring in COCO dataset .
Given the simple linear transformation being used , it is possible to quantify the importance of each single words ( in the question ) to the answer .
The paper uses the Class Activation Mapping ( CAM ) approach ( which uses the linear relation between softmax and nal image feature map ) to highlight the informative image regions relevant to the predicted answer .
