All in all , RL allows us to build a uni ed dialogue system , however , it often requires the agent to train in an interactive environment with real users across multiple domains .
In practice , agents are rst train using machine learning methods before continuous learning through RL .
The transition of NLP to Neural Approaches The 3 .
Present both supervised and reinforcement learning to train SOTA dialogue agents 4 . Draw out the conversational systems that are developed in both the research community and the industry , highlighting the progress and challenges of existing conversational systems 3 types of problems in Conversational AI ( 2 categories ) 1 . QA ( task-oriented ) .
Using multiple data sources , the agent need to provide a direct and accurate answers to user queries ( Turn 3 - 5 ) 2 . Task Completion ( task-oriented ) .
The agent is required to perform a speci c task like reservation , or scheduling a meeting ( Turn 6 - 7 ) 3 . Social Chat ( chitchat ) .
Provide smooth interactions with the user ( Turn 1 - 2 )
The typical architecture Typically , task - oriented conversational AI has 4 main components :
1 . Natural Language Understanding .
Understanding the user 's intent and extracting additional information 2 . State Tracker .
Tracking the state of the conversation and all essential information 3 . Dialog Policy .

Converting agent actions / results into natural language responses
The gure below showcase the 4 components in a task - oriented conversational AI and how recent work has been using deep neural network to combine all these components together , developing a fully data-driven system .
Task - oriented agents have access to external database whereas social chatbots do not since they are n't required to use external sources to complete a speci c task .
Therefore , social chatbots are usually trained using human-to-human conversational data .
However , recent work has begun to explore how to connect chitchat using world knowledge and images to make the conversation more contentful and interesting .
A Uni ed View : Dialogue as Optimal Decision Making
The idea behind a uni ed view for conversational AI is that conversations can be viewed as a decision making process whereby there 's a natural hierarchy of top-level process to select which agent we should use to solve a particular subtask ( the 3 types of problems ) and lowlevel process , where the selected agent performs actions to complete the subtask .
This can be formulated using Markov Decision Processes ( MDPs ) and both top- and low-level processes can be captured using the reinforcement learning ( RL ) framework .
The agent would navigate in a Papers Summary - Neural Approaches to Conversational AI - Introduction - Ryan Ong https://ryanong.co.uk/2020/05/06/day-127-nlp-papers-summary-neural-approaches-to-conversational-ai-introduction/ 4/8 MDP , where by at each step , the agent would observes the current state and choose an action based on the dialog policy .
The agent then receives a reward and observes a new state , repeating the cycle until the end .
The objective of the agent is to nd optimal policies that maximise the expected rewards .
The table below showcase this uni ed view of RL , where state-action space is map to different reward functions .
Two large-scale open-domain dialogue systems have already been developed with this uni ed view in mind : Sounding Board and Microsoft XiaoIce .
The reward functions in the table above seems contradictory in terms of CPS between task - oriented and chitchat .
Microsoft XiaoIce is optimised for expected CPS meaning it is optimised for maximising long-term engagement .
development of neural methods means that we are relying less and less on human engineered features .
Neural methods in machine reading comprehension ( MRC ) and dialogue usually consists of three steps as shown below :
1 . Encoding user input and knowledge into neural semantic representations ( embeddings ) 2 . Reasoning in the neural space to generate answer vector 3 .
Decoding the neural response into natural language output in the symbolic space ?

Existing works have been to develop a hybrid methods of the two , to capture the strengths of both neural and symbolic methods .
