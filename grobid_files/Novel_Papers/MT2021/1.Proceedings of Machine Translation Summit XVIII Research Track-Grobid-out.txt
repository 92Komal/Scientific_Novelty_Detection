Welcome to the 18th biennial conference of the International Association of Machine Translation (IAMT) -MT Summit 2021 Virtual! Dear MT Colleagues and Friends, This year's MT Summit is hosted by the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA). Every two years, the Summit is hosted on a rotating basis by one of the three sister organizations comprising IAMT: the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT), the Asian-Pacific Association for Machine Translation (AAMT), and of course, AMTA. While each of these organizations holds its own conferences annually or biennially, the Summit is always held in oddnumbered years, and this year, AMTA is grateful to have that honor. After a tremendously successful MT Summit XVII held in Dublin in 2019, we anticipated an equally successfully Summit in 2021 given the rapidly accelerating interest in and research and development of neural machine translation (NMT) in both academia and industry. But as you all know, the year 2020 brought a major surprise that no one anticipated. Our biennial AMTA conference, scheduled for the fall of 2020 in Orlando, Florida was transformed into a completely virtual conference after much consternation followed by a great deal of effort. We successfully rescheduled the MT Summit 2021 conference at the same venue for the following year, thinking that it would at least be a "hybrid" conference, but alas, here we are once again with a completely virtual conference. This decision was made late in the game last April when, based on the results of a survey of likely participants, it become obvious that the vast majority would not be attending in person. Recent spikes in the cases of COVID throughout the world have further justified our decision to go completely virtual. There have been some silver linings to this COVID cloud, however, the main one being that our AMTA 2020 virtual attendance was double that of previous years, and we anticipate that attendance for the virtual Summit will be at least double what it was in Dublin. We are also grateful that once again, we were able to reschedule our intended venue in Orlando, Florida for AMTA 2022. We hope that many of you will join us there in person! And yes, we will still add a virtual component to the conference for those who are yet unable to travel. But enough of this COVID-related confusion! We are very pleased with the response we have had to our calls for papers, presentations, workshops, tutorials, and exhibitions for MT Summit 2021 and we are sure you'll agree that the program is brimming with relevant, exciting, and useful information, not to mention the many opportunities to view the latest technology demonstrations and opportunities to network with colleagues both old and new from across the MT spectrum. The most unique aspect of these conferences is that they are truly global gatherings of MT researchers, developers, providers, and users. Academics, students, and commercial researchers and developers are able to share their latest results and offerings with colleagues, in addition to receiving and understanding real-world user requirements. Individual MT users, as well as those from language services providers, enterprises, and governments, benefit from updates on leading-edge R&D in machine translation and have a chance to present and discuss their use cases. At this point, I need to give some serious thanks to many organizations and individuals who have made this conference possible. First, we have received amazing support from our sponsors, for which we are tremendously grateful! Our visionary sponsor, Microsoft, made it possible for the first 150 students to register for the conference at a very significant discount, and those students quickly took advantage of this generous offer. Our Leader-level sponsors, who will be sponsoring our conference tracks, include: Apple, Intento, Lilt, Pangeanic, (RWS) Language Weaver, Systran, Vistatec, and Yandex Cloud. Our Patron-level sponsors are: Amazon (AWS), Facebook AI, Google, Kudo, Lengoo, Logrus Global, Star, and Welocalize. To all these companies we express our most sincere gratitude for their support of MT Summit 2021. Many of them will also give demonstrations of their systems and software during our Technology Exhibition Fair, and we hope that all our attendees will take advantage of this great opportunity to see the very latest commercial offerings and advancements in the world of MT. We are grateful to have three additional exhibitors in the Fair as well: CustomMT, KantanMT, and XTM. Finally, I need to give special thanks and recognition to the members of our organizing committee, all of whom have worked very hard and given many hours and days of their time, for the most part voluntarily, to make MT Summit 2021 a success. Listing their names and official positions doesn't really seem to be an adequate reflection of their work and sacrifice, but it's the best I can do here, and I trust they know how much their efforts are truly appreciated. 

 Introduction The research track at MTSummit 2021 continues the tradition of bringing MT practitioners together from academia, industry and government from around the world. This year we have a very rich program with 24 papers from a variety of topics. The most popular subject this year is low-resource machine translation, with papers spanning unsupervised MT, bilingual lexicon induction and curriculum learning. In addition, we have many works discussing modeling (e.g. transfer learning, domain adaptation and reinforcement learning); others discussing morphology (e.g. target-side inflection, subword tokenization); domain-specific translation (e.g. user-generated content translation, product-reviews); and papers performing error analyses of modern NMT systems and understanding their limitations. We are also excited about our invited keynote speakers for the research track: Lucia Specia (Imperial College London) will talk about Multimodal Simultaneous MT, while Graham Neubig (Carnegie Mellon University) will discuss Context-aware MT. We hope that this conference brings many productive exchanges of ideas and sparks future collaborations.
