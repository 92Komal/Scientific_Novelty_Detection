Findings of the WMT 2021 Shared Task on Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation

abstract
The results of all shared tasks were announced at the conference, and these proceedings also include overview papers for the shared tasks, summarizing the results, as well as providing information about the data used and any procedures that were followed in conducting or scoring the tasks. In addition, there are short papers from each participating team that describe their underlying system in greater detail. Like in previous years, we have received a far larger number of submissions than we could accept for presentation. WMT 2021 has received 49 full research paper submissions (not counting withdrawn submissions). In total, WMT 2021 featured 18 full research paper presentations and 96 shared task presentations. The event hosted a panel discussion led by Markus Freitag (Google) on evaluation with Nitika Mathur (Univ. Melbourne), Benjamin Marie (NICT), Ricardo Rei (Unbabel), Tom Kocmi (Microsoft). We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We also would like to thank the participants of the shared task and all the other volunteers who helped with the evaluations.
