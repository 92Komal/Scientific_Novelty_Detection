Joint Concept Learning and Semantic Parsing from Natural Language Explanations

abstract
Natural language constitutes a predominant medium for much of human learning and pedagogy. We consider the problem of concept learning from natural language explanations, and a small number of labeled examples of the concept. For example, in learning the concept of a phishing email, one might say 'this is a phishing email because it asks for your bank account number'. Solving this problem involves both learning to interpret open-ended natural language statements, as well as learning the concept itself. We present a joint model for (1) language interpretation (semantic parsing) and (2) concept learning (classification) that does not require labeling statements with logical forms. Instead, the model prefers discriminative interpretations of statements in context of observable features of the data as a weak signal for parsing. On a dataset of email-related concepts, this approach yields across-theboard improvements in classification performance, with a 30% relative improvement in F1 score over competitive classification methods in the low data regime.

Introduction The ability to automatically learn concepts 1 from examples is a core cognitive ability, with applications across diverse domains. Examples of such concepts include the concept of a 'negative review' in product reviews, the concept of 'check' over the domain of game states in chess, the concept of 'fraud' in credit history analysis, etc. Concept learning is generally approached using classification 1 where a concept is any Boolean function on some domain of instances. methods that can automatically leverage regularities in large amounts of labeled training data. However, there are two shortcomings of this paradigm. First, labeling large amounts of data is unnatural compared to how a person might teach another person (e.g., a human secretary) in a similar situation. For example, for identifying emails about postdoc positions, a university professor might say 'These inquiries usually seek a postdoc opportunity and include a CV', rather than label scores of examples of such emails. Second, acquiring large quantities of labeled data may be infeasible because of a long tail of concepts that are highly domain or user specific. For our example of a busy professor, it might be relevant to teach concepts such as 'postdoc seeking emails', 'course related questions from students', etc. to an email assistant in order to better manage her/his inbox. However, these concepts might be irrelevant to a general user. On the other hand, humans can efficiently learn about new concepts and phenomena through language. In fact, verbal and written language form the basis for much of human learning and pedagogy, as reflected in text-books, lectures and student-teacher dialogues. Natural language explanations can be a potent mode of supervision, and can alleviate issues of data sparsity by directly encoding relevant knowledge about concepts. Figure  1  shows examples of concepts explained using natural language. In general, natural language can subsume several modes of supervision: instance labeling (e.g., 'This email is spam'), feature labeling (e.g., 'The word 'Viagra' indicates spam'), model expectations ('Spam emails rarely come from edu extensions'), etc. However, here we focus on the ability of natural language to express rich and compositional features for characterizing concepts. In this paper, we address the task of learning concepts from natural language statements and a small number of labeled examples of the concept. Figure  2  summarizes the outline of our approach. We map statements to logical interpretations, which can be evaluated in context of new instances. In doing this, each statement s effectively acts as a binary feature function {z = f s (x) ? {0, 1}} that fires when the interpretation of a statement s is true for an instance x. The crux of our approach is that correct interpretations of natural language explanations are more likely to be useful in discriminating concepts, and this observation can be used to guide both semantic interpretation and concept learning 2 . In Section 3, we describe our probabilistic latent variable formulation that learns a semantic parser and a concept classifier from labeled examples of the concept. The latent variables correspond to evaluations of natural language statements for different instances, and training proceeds via a generalized EM procedure that iteratively (1) estimates evaluations of explanations (marginalizing over all 2 e.g., a parser may associate multiple incorrect interpretations with the statement in Figure  2  (like stringMatch(attachment stringVal ('usually'))), which are unlikely to help in discriminating instances of the concept. interpretations), and (2) updates the classification and semantic parsing models. The inputs to the method consist of a small number of labeled examples and non-examples of a concept, natural language statements explaining the concept, and a domain specific lexicon. The method does not require labeling sentences with logical forms. For our empirical evaluation, we focus on personal emails, a practical example of a domain where target concepts are often highly individualized and labeled data is scarce. The contributions of this work are: ? We introduce the problem of concept learning from natural language. We also collect a corpus of emails about common email concepts, along with statements from human users explaining these concepts. ? We provide a method for concept learning and language understanding that can be trained from a small number of labeled concept instances. Thus, we extend supervised semantic parsing by learning from a weaker form of supervision than has previously been explored. ? We demonstrate that for small labeled data, using natural language statements can achieve substantial gains in classification accuracy. 

 Related work Concept learning from labeled examples has been a dominant focus of research in supervised learning  (Caruana et al., 2008) . Notable approaches such as Generalized Expectation  (Mann and McCallum, 2010)  and Posterior Regularization  (Ganchev et al., 2010)  have explored integration of manually provided 'side-information' (feature and label constraints) to guide machine learning models. Earlier work on Explanation-based learning  (Mitchell et al., 1986; DeJong and Mooney, 1986)   Semantic interpretation of language has been explored in diverse domains. While semantic parsers have traditionally relied on labeled datasets of statements paired with labeled logical forms  (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005) , recent approaches have focused on training semantic parsers from denotations of logical forms, rather than logical forms themselves  (Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012; Berant et al., 2013) . Our work extends this paradigm by attempting to learn from still weaker signal, where denotations (evaluations) of logical forms too are not directly observed. Similar to our work, previous approaches have used different kinds of external-world signals to guide semantic interpretation  (Liang et al., 2009; Branavan et al., 2009) . Natural instructions have been studied in game playing frameworks  (Branavan et al., 2012; Eisenstein et al., 2009) . Our work is also closely related to work by  Goldwasser and Roth (2014) ;  Clarke et al. (2010) , who also train semantic parsers in weakly supervised contexts, where language interpretation is integrated in real-world tasks. The general idea of learning through human interactions has previously been explored in settings such as behavioral programming  (Harel et al., 2012) , natural language programming  (Biermann, 1983) , learning by instruction  (Azaria et al., 2016) , etc. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to use semantic interpretation to guide concept learning. 

 Method We consider concept learning problems in which the goal is to approximate an unknown classification function f : X ? Y where Y = {0, 1}. The input to our learning algorithm consists of a set of labeled training examples T := {(x 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (x m , y m )}, along with a set of natural language statements S := {s 1 . . . s n } about the concept. Our aim is to leverage statements in S to learn a better classifier for the concept. Our training data does not contain any other form of supervision (such as logical forms). Figure  3 : Our data consist of instances x i with binary labels y i and statements s 1 . . . s n about a concept. z ij denotes whether the statement s j applies to instance x i , and is not observed in the data. We assume that each statement s j defines some Boolean property over the instances X; that is, statement s j should be interpreted as defining a predicate l j : X ? {0, 1}. We augment the representation of each instance, x i , with a feature vector z i , that encodes the information contained in S. The individual elements of this feature vector, z ij ? {0, 1}, denote whether the statement s j applies to instance x i (see Figure  3 ). In the general case, the evaluation values z i 's are not directly observed. These are obtained by parsing each statement s j into a logical expression l j : X ? {0, 1} which can be evaluated for an instance x i to obtain z ij = l j x i . Details of this evaluation are given in Section 3.4. In this paper, we jointly learn a classifier and a semantic parser while treating z's as latent variables. For training, we maximize the conditional log likelihood of the observed data. Let us consider the log likelihood for a single data instance (ignoring the subscript i) for now. Since the evaluations z of natural statements for any context are latent, we marginalize over these. Using Jensen's inequality, any distribution q over the latent variables provides a lower-bound on the data log-likelihood: log p(y | x, S) = log z p(y, z | x, S) ? z q(z) log p(y, z | x, S) q(z) = z q(z) log p ?c (y | z, x) classification + log p ?p (z | x, S) parsing + H q (1) Here, H q is the entropy term for the distribution q. 

 Coupling parsing and classification: In Equation  1 , we observe that the data likelihood decouples into the log probability of observing the concept labels p ?c (y i | z, x) conditioned on the statement evaluations and the log probability of the latent statement evaluations p ?p (z | x, S). In particular, the first term can be naturally parametrized by a discriminative classifier such as a loglinear model (with associated parameters ? c ). We provide more details in Section 3.3. On the other hand, the probability of the latent statement evaluation values z can be parametrized using a probabilistic semantic parsing model (with associated parameters ? p ). The second term decouples over evaluations of individual statements (log p ?p (z | x, S) = j log p ?p (z j | x, s j )). In turn, since we never observe the correct interpretation l for any statement, but only model its evaluation z j , we marginalize over all interpretations whose evaluations in a context x matches z j (similar to  Liang et al. (2011)) . log p ?p (z j | x, s j ) = log l: l x=zj p ?p (l | s j ) (2) Following recent work in semantic parsing  (Liang and Potts, 2015; Krishnamurthy and Mitchell, 2012) , we use a log-linear model over logical forms: p ?p (l | s) ? exp(? p T ?(s, l)) (3) where ?(s, l) ? R d is a feature vector over statements s and logical interpretations l. 

 Learning: In Equation  1 , q(z) denotes a distribution over evaluation values of statements; whereas ? c and ? p denote the model parameters for the classifier and semantic parser. The learning algorithm consists of an iterative generalized EM procedure, which can be interpreted as a block-coordinate ascent in the estimates of statement evaluations q(z) and the model parameters ? c and ? p . 

 E-step: In the E-step, we update our estimates of evaluation variables (z). We make a mean-field approximation by assuming that the joint distribution over evaluations decouples as q(z) = q j (z j ). Then maximizing the lower bound in Equation 1 in terms of q j leads to the following update: q j (z j ) ? exp E j =j [log p ?c (z|x)]+log p ?p (z j |x, s j ) (4) The first term in the update prefers values of an evaluation variable that are more discriminative on average (when values of other statements are marginalized out). The second term favours values of the evaluation variable that conforms with the most likely interpretations of the corresponding statement (s j ) by the semantic parser. Thus, in the E-step, we upweight evaluations of statements that are both discriminative, as well as supported by interpretations from the semantic parser. 

 M-step: In the M-step, we update the model parameters to maximize the lower bound in Equation  1 . This corresponds to independently optimizing the log likelihoods for the classification model and the semantic parser, based on current estimates of q j (z j )'s of the statement evaluations. The entropy term H q is constant from the perspective of model parameters, and is not relevant for the optimization. In particular, the semantic parser is updated to agree with evaluations of natural language statements that are discriminative. At the same time, the classification model is updated to fit evaluations that are supported by interpretations from the semantic parser. We now describe the M-step updates for the loglinear semantic parser with parameters, ? p . The updates for the classifier parameters, ? c , depend on the form of the classification model, and are described in Section 3.3. For clarity, we focus on updates corresponding to a particular statement s j from the training dataset. From Equations 1, 2 and 3, the objective for the semantic parser is given by: j (?p) = i z?{0,1} q(zij) log l: l x i =z exp(?p T ?(sj, l)) l exp(?p T ?(sj, l)) (5) Semantic parsers are usually optimized using gradient updates. Here, the gradient is: ? j (?p) = i,z,l q(zij)p ?p (l | s) p ?p (zij = z|xi, s) p ?p (zij = z|xi, s) ?(sj, l) (6) 

 Classification models The model and learning procedure described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 is agnostic to the choice of the classification model (with parameters ? c ). For this work, we experimented with a logistic classifier (LR) and a Naive Bayes model (NB). We briefly describe these here: Logistic Regression (LR): The form of the logistic function log p(y|z) = ? log(1 + exp(-? T c z y)) means that the likelihood does not decouple for individual components in z. Hence, in the E-step, the expectation in Equation 4 cannot be computed analytically. Instead, we estimate this by drawing Bernoulli samples for individual z j 's using previous estimates of q j (z j ). In the M-step, we update classification parameters ? c using stochastic gradient updates, while again sampling individual z j 's. Naive Bayes (NB): The likelihood for this model is p(y, z) = j ? z j cy (1 ? ? cy ) 1?z j . In this case, the individual components of z decouple in the log likelihood, leading to simple updates in both the E and M steps. While this is not a conditional likelihood (as expected in Section 3.1), in our experiments we found that the NB objective to be empirically effective with our approach. 

 Semantic Parsing details Semantic parsing refers to mapping a sentence s like 'The subject contains the word postdoc' to a logical form l like getPhraseMention(subject, stringVal('postdoc')). Logical forms can be evaluated in a context x (here, an email) to yield some meaningful output l x (whether the statement is true for an email). The predicates (such as stringVal) and constants (such as subject) come from a pre-specified logical language. Since our focus in this work is concepts about emails, we specify a logical language that is expressive enough to be useful for concept learning in this domain. Table  1  lists the predicates in our logical language along with descriptions of their evaluation, and some illustrative examples showing how they can represent the meaning of natural statements 3 . Note that this logical language can express compositional meanings. e.g., 'These inquiries will usually seek a postdoc opportunity  3  We include a special predicate (unknown) to label statements whose meanings go beyond our logical language (last row in Table  1 ), essentially ignoring them. Such statements compose about 25% of our data. An agent should ideally be able to ask a user about unfamiliar concepts such as 'weird email addresses' that occur in explanations. See Section 6. and include a CV' can be expressed as and (getPhrasesLike(email, stringVal('seek postdoc opportunity')), (stringMatch attachment (stringVal'CV'))). The evaluations of some predicates uses NLP tools that go beyond exact keyword matching. In Section 5, we show that it is language understanding (semantic parsing), rather than these resources, which enables learning from natural explanations. Semantic parsers involve grammars containing mappings from words to symbols in the logical language, as well as coarse syntactic rules. The grammar specifies the possible set of logical interpretations that can be associated with a natural language sentence. For this work, we use CCG based semantic parsing, a popular semantic parsing approach  (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2005; Artzi et al., 2015)  that couples syntax with semantics. For the CCG grammar, we manually compile a domain lexicon containing a list of trigger words mapped to their syntactic categories and associated logical predicates. e.g. {'subject', NP, subject}. We then use the PAL lexicon induction algorithm (Krishnamurthy, 2016) to expand the lexicon by adding automatically generated entries. For training the parser, we follow the feature set from  (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) , consisting of indicator features for lexicon entries and rule applications that fire for a given parse of a logical form. We also include string based features denoting the number of words in a string span, and whether a string spans occur at the beginning or end of the utterance. For retrieving the best parses for a statement, we use beam search with a beam size of 500. While we have chosen a particular instantiation of a semantic parsing formalism, our learning approach is independent of the semantic parsing framework in principle, and only assumes a loglinear parametrization over logical interpretations of sentences. Thus, while we present results for a particular parsing framework and lexicon, the method may conceptually extend to other parsing formalisms such as DCS  (Liang et al., 2011) . 

 Data We created a dataset of 1,030 emails paired with 235 natural language statements made by human users in the process of teaching a set of seven concepts. The dataset was collected using the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. We deployed two tasks: (i) a Generation task requiring workers to create original emails, and (ii) a Teaching task requiring workers to write statements that characterize a concept. Below, we describe the data and the two tasks in more detail. We create an email corpus, rather than use an existing corpus such as Enron, since we wanted diverse examples representative of everyday concepts that most people would be able to understand as well as teach to a computer. Much of the Enron corpus is highly specific and contextualized, making it difficult to teach for an outsider. The Generation task consisted of a web-page resembling a traditional email composition form (with fields: recipient, subject, body, attachment), requiring workers to compose emails in a grounded setting. For this task, we recruited 146 workers residing in the United States. The workers were presented with each of the seven concepts in a sequence, where each concept was represented by a short prompt encouraging workers to imagine a scenario (e.g., a boss writing a request to an employee) and write a hypothetical email. See Table  2  for details of email concepts and corresponding prompts. Workers were instructed to be realistic (e.g., to include an attachment if an email is likely to have an attachment in reality), but also creative (to encourage diversity) in composing their emails. The Teaching task was then deployed to collect natural language statements that people would Figure  4 : The Teaching task used to collect natural language statements characterizing a concept. Each worker is given a concept prompt, together with a set of emails. A turker can enter five statements characterizing the concept. These emails usually closes with a name or title Some reminders will have a date and time in the subject The body of the email may say funny, picture, or internet Messages to friends sometimes have jpg attachments Emails from a public domain are not office requests Table  3 : Examples of natural language statements collected from the Teaching task make to teach a particular concept to a machine. Workers were presented with five randomly selected concepts using the same prompts (Table  2 ) used in the Generation task. For each concept, a small sample of emails were shown in a style resembling a traditional email inbox (Figure  4 ) to illustrate the concept. Half of the emails were from the prompted concept (these emails were highlighted and "starred"), and half were sampled randomly from the other concepts. Workers were encouraged to peruse through the emails while creating up to five statements explaining the concept. A followup quiz assessed an understanding of the task, and contributions from workers with low scores were filtered. The final data contains between 30 and 35 statements describing each category. 

 Evaluation In this section, we evaluate the performance of our approach from the perspectives of concept learn-Concept # of emails Prompt CONTACT 167 "You are writing an email to yourself to personally keep note of a person contact" EMPLOYEE 149 "You are a boss writing an email to your employee requesting something to be done" EVENT 138 "You are writing an email to a friend asking to meet up at some event" HUMOR 134 "You are writing an email to a friend that includes something humorous from the Internet" MEETING 142 "You are writing an email to a colleague trying to request a meeting about something" POLICY 146 "You are writing an office email regarding announcement of some new policy" REMINDER 154 "You are writing an email to yourself as a reminder to do something" For evaluating semantic parsing of natural language statements, we manually annotated the statements in our dataset using the logical language described in Section 3.4. In Table  4 , LNL-Gold denotes the classification performance with using these annotated gold parses. This corresponds to the hypothetical case where the classifier knows the correct semantic interpretation of each natural language sentence from an oracle. While this provides a further 10% relative improvement over our proposed models, the results suggest that our weakly supervised method is quite effective in interpreting natural language statements for concept learning, without explicit supervision. We also observe that LNL models perform significantly better than Keyword filtering (p < 0.05), indicating that the model leverages the expressiveness of our logical language. Finally, the last three rows show performance when the LNL methods also utilize BoW representations of the data. The further gains over the base LNL models suggest that original feature representations and natural language explanations contain complementary information for many concepts. A significant motivation for this work is the promise of natural language explanations in facilitating concept learning with a relatively small number of examples. Figure  5  shows the dependence of concept learning performance of LNL(-LR) on the number of labeled training examples (size of training set). We observe that while our approach consistently outperforms the bag-of-words model (BoW), LNL also requires fewer examples to reach near optimal performance, before it plateaus. In particular, the generalization performance for LNL is more robust than BoW for n < 10. The performance trajectory for LNL(-NB) is similar, and omitted in the figure for clarity.  Parsing performance: We next evaluate the parsing performance of our approach, which learns a semantic parser from only concept labels of examples. Table  5  evaluates parsing performance against the gold annotation logical forms for statements. For this task, we check for exact match of logical forms. In the table, full supervision refers to traditional training of a semantic parser using complete annotations of statements with their logical forms  (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) . The results report average accuracy over 10-fold CV, and demonstrate that while not comparable to supervised parsing, our weakly supervised approach is relatively effective in learning semantic parsers. Further, exact match to gold annotated logical forms is a restrictive measure. Qualitative analysis revealed that even when the predicted and gold annotation logical forms don't match, predicted logical forms are often strongly correlated in terms of evaluation to gold annotations. e.g., getPhraseMention( email, stringVal('postdoc')) vs getPhraseMention( body, stringVal('postdoc')). In about 5% of cases, predicted and gold interpretations are different on the surface, but are semantically equivalent (e.g., stringEquals( sender, recipient) vs stringEquals( recipient, sender)). 

 Concept learning vs language interpretation: To delineate the relationship between parsing performance and concept learning more clearly, we plot concept classification performance for different levels of semantic parsing proficiency in Figure  6 . For this, we choose the gold annotation logical form for a statement with a probability corresponding to the semantic parsing accuracy, or randomly select a candidate logical form with a uniform probability otherwise for all the statements in our data. The figure shows a (expectedly) strong association between parsing performance and concept learning, although gains from parsing taper after a certain level of proficiency. This is partially explained by the fact that natural statements in our  

 Conclusion and Future Work We show that natural language explanations can be utilized by supervised learning methods to significantly improve generalization. This suggests a broader class of possible machine learning interfaces that use language to not only expedite learning, but make machine learning accessible to everyday users. Thus, we hope that the current work will inspire further explorations in learning from natural language explanations. In terms of scalability, learning from language would require specification of a logical language and a lexicon of trigger words for each new domain. However, this effort is onetime, and can find re-use across the long tail of concepts in a domain. A consequence of the expressiveness of language is that in describing a concept, humans often invoke other concepts that may not correspond to existing predicates in the logical language. A natural solution could detect that a feature described in the statement is novel 4 , and request the user to teach the unknown concept. The same principle can be applied recursively, resulting in a mixed-initiative dialog, much like between a student and a teacher. Future work can also incorporate other modes of supervision from language. For example, this work ignores modifiers such as 'always' and 'usually', which often carry valuable information that could be incorporated via model expectation constraints.
