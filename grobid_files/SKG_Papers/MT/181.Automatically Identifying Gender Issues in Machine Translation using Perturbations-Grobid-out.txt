Automatically Identifying Gender Issues in Machine Translation using Perturbations

abstract
The successful application of neural methods to machine translation has realized huge quality advances for the community. With these improvements, many have noted outstanding challenges, including the modeling and treatment of gendered language. While previous studies have identified issues using synthetic examples, we develop a novel technique to mine examples from real world data to explore challenges for deployed systems. We use our method to compile an evaluation benchmark spanning examples for four languages from three language families, which we publicly release to facilitate research. The examples in our benchmark expose where model representations are gendered, and the unintended consequences these gendered representations can have in downstream application.

Introduction Machine translation (MT) has realized huge improvements in quality from the successful application and development of neural methods  (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Vaswani et al., 2017; Johnson et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018) . As the community has explored this enhanced performance, many have noted the outstanding challenge of modeling and handling gendered language  (Kuczmarski, 2018; Escud? Font and Costa-juss?, 2019) . We extend this line of work, which identifies issues using synthetic examples manually curated for a target language  (Stanovsky et al., 2019; Cho et al., 2019) , by analyzing real world text across a range of languages to understand challenges for deployed systems. In this paper, we explore the class of issues which surface when a neutral reference to a person is translated to a gendered form (e.g. in Table  1 , where the English counselor and nurse are translated into the French conseiller (masculine) and infirmi?re (feminine). For this class of examples, the MT task requires a system to produce a single translation without source cues, thus exposing a model's preferred gender for the reference form. With this scope, we make two key contributions. First, we design and implement an automatic pipeline for detecting examples of our class of gender issues in real world input, using a BERTbased perturbation method novel to this work. A key advantage of our pipeline beyond previous work is its extensibility: a) beyond word lists; b) to different language pairs and c) parts of speech. Second, using our new pipeline, we compile a dataset that we make publicly available to serve as a benchmark for future work. We focus on English as the source language, and explore four target gendered languages across three language families (French, German, Spanish, and Russian). Our examples expose where MT encodings are gendered, finding new issues not covered in previous manual approaches, and the unintended consequences of this for translation. 

 Gender Marking Languages Gender-marking languages have rich grammatical systems for expressing gender  (Corbett, 1991) . To produce a valid sentence in a gender-marking language, gender may need to be marked not only on pronouns (he, she), as it is in English, but also nouns and even verbs, as well as words linked to these gendered nouns and verbs. This means that translating from a language like English, with little gender marking, to a gender-marking language like Spanish, requires a system to produce gender markings that may not have explicit evidence in the source. For instance, The tall teacher from English could be translated into the Spanish La maestra alta (feminine) or El maestro alto (masculine). Source Sentence (En) Translation (Fr) M/F so is that going to affect my chances of becoming a counselor? Alors, est -ce que cela va affecter mes chances de devenir conseiller? M so is that going to affect my chances of becoming a nurse? Alors, est -ce que cela va affecter mes chances de devenir infirmi?re? F Table  1 : An example from our dataset of a minimal pair of English gender-neutral source sentences, translated into two different genders in French.

 Automatic Detection of Gender Issues The In this section, we present a simple, extensible method to mine such examples from real-world text. Our method does not require expansive manuallycurated word lists for each target language, which enables us to discover new kinds of entities that are susceptible to model bias but are not usually thought of this way. Indeed, while we demonstrate its utility with nouns with four target languages, our method is naturally extensible to new language pairs and parts of speech with no change in design. Filtering source sentences Our first step is to identify sentences that are gender neutral and that include a single human entity, e.g. A doctor works in a hospital. We focus on human entities since these have been the target of previous studies and present the largest risk of gender issues in translation. We use a BERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model that identifies human entities, and exclude sentences that have more than one token tagged as such. We also remove sentences in which the entity is a gendered term in English 1 (e.g. mother, nephew), a name, or not a noun. Note that all the sentences we get are naturally occurring sentences, and that we do not use any templates or predefined lists of target words that we want to handle. 

 Perturbations using BERT We use BERT as a masked language model to find words which can substitute for the human entity identified in the previous filtering step, e.g. doctor ? nurse. We aim to get natural-sounding output and maintain extensibility, and thus do not use predefined substitutions. We cap our search to the first 100 candidates BERT returns, accepting the first 10 which are tagged as person, and for which the resulting sentences also pass the filtering step. Translation We translate each of the generated sentences into our target languages using Google Translate 2 . A doctor/nurse works in a hospital ? Un doctor/Una enfermera trabaja en un hospital. Alignment We align tokens in the original and translated sentences using fast-align  (Dyer et al., 2010) . This is needed in order to know which token in the translation output is the focus entity in the source sentence, whose gender we want to analyze. 

 Gender Identification We use a morphological analyzer, implemented following  Kong et al. (2017) , to tag the gender of the target word. 

 Identifying Examples The final step of our pipeline is identifying pairs of sentences to include in our dataset, pairs where different genders are assigned to the human entity. Our example would be included since doctor is translated with the masculine form Un doctor while nurse is translated with the feminine form Una enfermera. 

 Challenge Dataset We compile our final dataset from the output of this pipeline, and explore its properties to understand the issues it represents for deployed systems. 

 Random Sampling In our final dataset, we include both examples that passed the final example identification step above (pairs referred to as "at risk"), as well as a random selection that did not ("not at risk"). We do this in order to not be constrained too heavily by our choice of translation model; if we did not, we would have no chance of inspecting examples that our system did not spot as at risk but other models might have. 

 Fixed Grammatical Gender Rating When we inspected the examples identified as at risk by our pipeline, the major source of error we found pertained to the issue of fixed grammatical gender. Consider the example in Figure  1 : Sentence 1: En: you don't have to be the victim in whatever. Fr: vous ne devez pas ?tre la victime de quoi que ce soit. Sentence 2: En: you don't have to be the expert in whatever. Fr: vous ne devez pas ?tre l'expert en quoi que ce soit. Figure  1 : An example from our dataset, with fixed grammatical gender. Red (italic) stands for masculine, cyan (normal) stands for feminine. In this example, the word victim in the first English sentence is identified by our tagger as a human entity. However, its French translation victime is feminine by definition, and cannot be assigned another gender regardless of the context, causing a false positive result. We attempted to filter these examples automatically but came across a number of challenges. Most critically, we found no highquality, comprehensive dictionary that included the required information for all languages, and heuristics we applied were noisy and not reliable.  3  We observed that the underlying reason for these challenges was that there is no closed list of grammatically-fixed words as languages are evolving to be more gender-inclusive. In order to maximize and guarantee data quality, and to be sensitive to the nuances of language change, we decided to add a manual filtering step after our pipeline to select the positive (at risk) examples. We note that the problem of fixed grammatical gender is particular to nouns. Our pipeline is naturally extensible across parts of speech and we would not expect the same issues in future work perturbing adjectives or verbs. 

 Dataset Statistics To create our dataset we mine text from the subreddit "career".  4  From 29,330 sentences, we found 4,016 which referred to a single, non-gendered human entity. Introducing perturbations with BERT into these 4,016 sentences yielded 40,160 pairs. Out of those, 592 to 1,012 pairs are identified as at risk by our pipeline, depending on the target language. We asked humans to manually identify 100 true at risk examples for the final dataset, which was achieved for all languages except Russian, where we have 59 pairs. 5 To this 100, we add a further 100 randomly sampled negative examples for each language. Table  2  shows a representative example for each language-pair. 

 Exploratory Analysis Table  3  lists the most frequent focus personal references in each language-pair among the positive (at risk) and negative (not at risk) examples, along with the ratio between times the reference form was translated as masculine compared to feminine. Words with extreme values of this ratio indicate cases where a model has a systematic preference for one gender over another, i.e. a gendered representation. Among the negative examples, we see a prior for masculine translations across all terms. Positive examples break from this prior by exposing reference forms with a feminine preference: nurse and secretary are the most consistently feminine forms, consistent with the Bureau of Labor statistics used in previous work  (Caliskan et al., 2017) . Figure  2  shows two sentence pairs that appear as positive examples across all four language-pairs. Two of the three forms, nurse and mechanic, are consistent with the gender statistics of Caliskan et al.; the association of fighter with the masculine gender is a new discovery of our method.

A separate but related line of work focuses on generating correct inflections when translating to gender-marking languages  (Vanmassenhove et al., 2018; Moryossef et al., 2019) . 

 Conclusion The primary contribution of our work is a novel, automatic method for identifying gender issues in machine translation. By performing BERT-based perturbations on naturally-occurring sentences, we are able to identify sentence pairs that behave differently upon translation to gender-marking languages. We demonstrate our technique over human reference forms and discover new sources of risk beyond the word lists used previously. Furthermore, the novelty of our approach is its natural extensibility to new language pairs, text genres, and different parts of speech. We look forward to future work exploring such applications. Using our new method, we compile a dataset across four languages from three language families. By publicly releasing our dataset, we hope to enable the community to work together towards solutions that are inclusive and equitable to all. Prates et al. (2019)  and Stanovsky et al.
