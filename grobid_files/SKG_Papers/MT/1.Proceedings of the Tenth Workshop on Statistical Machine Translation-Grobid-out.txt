Preface The EMNLP 2015 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (WMT 2015) took place on  Thursday and Friday, September 17-18, 2015  in Lisbon, Portugal, immediately preceding the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). This was the tenth time this workshop has been held. The first time it was held at  HLT-NAACL 2006  in New York City, USA. In the following years the Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation was held at ACL 2007 in Prague,  Czech Republic, ACL 2008 , Columbus, Ohio, USA, EACL 2009 in Athens, Greece, ACL 2010 in Uppsala, Sweden, EMNLP 2011 in Edinburgh, Scotland, NAACL 2012 in Montreal, Canada, ACL 2013 in Sofia, Bulgaria, and ACL 2014  in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The focus of our workshop was to use parallel corpora for machine translation. Recent experimentation has shown that the performance of SMT systems varies greatly with the source language. In this workshop we encouraged researchers to investigate ways to improve the performance of SMT systems for diverse languages, including morphologically more complex languages, languages with partial free word order, and low-resource languages. Prior to the workshop, in addition to soliciting relevant papers for review and possible presentation, we conducted five shared tasks: a general translation task, an automatic post-editing task, a quality estimation task, a metrics task, and a tuning task. The automatic post-editing task was introduced this year as a pilot to examine the capabilities of automatic methods for correcting errors produced by machine translation systems. This year's tuning task is a follow up of the WMT 2011 invitation-only tunable metrics task to assess a system's ability to optimize the parameters of a given hierarchical MT system. The results of all shared tasks were announced at the workshop, and these proceedings also include an overview paper for the shared tasks that summarizes the results, as well as provides information about the data used and any procedures that were followed in conducting or scoring the task. In addition, there are short papers from each participating team that describe their underlying system in greater detail. Like in previous years, we have received a far larger number of submission than we could accept for presentation. This year we have received 28 full paper submissions and 47 shared task submissions. In total WMT 2015 featured 11 full paper oral presentations and 46 shared task poster presentations. The invited talk was given by Jacob Devlin (Microsoft Research), entitled "A Practical Guide to Real-Time Neural Translation". We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We also would like to thank the participants of the shared task and all the other volunteers who helped with the evaluations.
