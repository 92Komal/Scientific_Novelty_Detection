title
The focus of our conference was to use parallel corpora for machine translation. Recent experimentation has shown that the performance of MT systems varies greatly with the source language. In this conference we encouraged researchers to investigate ways to improve the performance of MT systems for diverse languages, including morphologically more complex languages, languages with partial free word order, and low-resource languages. Prior to the conference, in addition to soliciting relevant papers for review and possible presentation, we conducted 8 shared tasks. This consisted of three translation tasks: Machine Translation of News, Biomedical Translation, and Multimodal Machine Translation, two evaluation tasks: Metrics and Quality Estimation, as well as the Automatic Post-Editing, Neural MT Training, and the Bandit Learning tasks. Two of these tasks were run at WMT for the first time. The Neural MT Training task provide comparable conditions and encouraging researchers to explore training methods that lead to improved and more robust translation quality and help speed up the training. The Bandit Learning Task encourages participants to train and improve MT systems by learning from weak or partial feedback instead of the commonly used gold-standard human-generated translations

abstract
The results of all shared tasks were announced at the conference, and these proceedings also include overview papers for the shared tasks, summarizing the results, as well as providing information about the data used and any procedures that were followed in conducting or scoring the tasks. In addition, there are short papers from each participating team that describe their underlying system in greater detail. Like in previous years, we have received a far larger number of submissions than we could accept for presentation. This year we have received 40 full research paper submissions. In total, WMT 2017 featured 16 full paper oral presentations and 59 shared task poster presentations. Holger Schwenk gave the invited on "Multilingual Representions and Applications in NLP". We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews. We also would like to thank the participants of the shared task and all volunteers who helped with the evaluations.
