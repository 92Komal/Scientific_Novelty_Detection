title
Translationese as a Language in "Multilingual" NMT

abstract
Machine translation has an undesirable propensity to produce "translationese" artifacts, which can lead to higher BLEU scores while being liked less by human raters. Motivated by this, we model translationese and original (i.e. natural) text as separate languages in a multilingual model, and pose the question: can we perform zero-shot translation between original source text and original target text? There is no data with original source and original target, so we train a sentence-level classifier to distinguish translationese from original target text, and use this classifier to tag the training data for an NMT model. Using this technique we bias the model to produce more natural outputs at test time, yielding gains in human evaluation scores on both adequacy and fluency. Additionally, we demonstrate that it is possible to bias the model to produce translationese and game the BLEU score, increasing it while decreasing human-rated quality. We analyze these outputs using metrics measuring the degree of translationese, and present an analysis of the volatility of heuristic-based train-data tagging.

Introduction "Translationese" is a term that refers to artifacts present in text that was translated into a given language that distinguish it from text originally written in that language  (Gellerstam, 1986) . These artifacts include lexical and word order choices that are influenced by the source language  (Gellerstam, 1996)  as well as the use of more explicit and simpler constructions  (Baker et al., 1993) . These differences between translated and original text mean that the direction in which parallel data (bitext) was translated is potentially important for machine translation (MT) systems. Most *Work done while at Google Research. parallel data is either source-original (the source was translated into the target) or target-original (the target was translated into the source), though sometimes neither side is original because both were translated from a third language. Figure  1  illustrates the four possible combinations of translated and original source and target data. Recent work has examined the impact of translationese in MT evaluation, using the WMT evaluation campaign as the most prominent example. From 2014 through 2018, WMT test sets were constructed such that 50% of the sentence pairs are source-original (upper right quadrant of Figure  1 ) and the rest are target-original (lower left quadrant).  Toral et al. (2018) ,  Zhang and Toral (2019) , and  Graham et al. (2019)  have examined the effect of this testing setup on MT evaluation, and have all argued that target-original test data should not be included in future evaluation campaigns because the translationese source is too easy to translate. While target-original test data does have the downside of a translationese source side, recent work has also shown that human raters prefer MT output that is closer in distribution to original target text than translationese  (Freitag et al., 2019) . This indicates that the target side of test data should also be original (upper left quadrant of Figure  1 ); however, it is unclear how to produce high-quality test data (let alone training data) that is simultaneously sourceand target-original. Because of this lack of original-to-original sentence pairs, we frame this as a zero-shot translation task, where translationese and original text are distinct languages or domains. We adapt techniques from zero-shot translation with multilingual models  (Johnson et al., 2016) , where the training pairs are tagged with a reserved token corresponding to the domain of the target side: translationese or original text. Tagging is helpful when the training set mixes data of different types by allowing the model to 1) see each pair's type in training to preserve distinct behaviors and avoid regressing to a mean/dominant prediction across data types, and 2) elicit different behavior in inference, i.e. providing a tag at test time yields predictions resembling a specific data type. We then investigate what happens when the input is an original sentence in the source language and the model's output is also biased to be original, a scenario never observed in training. Tagging in this fashion is not trivial, as most MT training sets do not annotate which pairs are sourceoriginal and which are target-original 1 , so in order to distinguish them we train binary classifiers to distinguish original and translated target text. Finally, we perform several analyses of tagging these "languages" and demonstrate that tagged back-translation  can be framed as a simplified version of our method, and thereby improved by targeted decoding. Our contributions are as follows: 1. We propose two methods to train translationese classifiers using only monolingual text, coupled with synthetic text produced by machine translation. 

 Using only original?translationese and translationese?original training pairs, we apply techniques from zero-shot multilingual MT to enable original?original translation. 3. We demonstrate with human evaluations that this technique improves translation quality, both in terms of fluency and adequacy. 4. We show that biasing the model to instead produce translationese outputs inflates BLEU scores while harming quality as measured by human evaluations. 

 Classifier Training + Tagging Motivated by prior work detailing the importance of distinguishing translationese from original text  (Kurokawa et al., 2009; Lembersky et al., 2012; Toral et al., 2018; Zhang and Toral, 2019; Graham et al., 2019; Freitag et al., 2019; Edunov et al., 2019)  as well as work in zero-shot translation  (Johnson et al., 2016) , we hypothesize that performance on the source-original translation task can be improved by distinguishing target-original and target-translationese examples in the training data and constructing an NMT model to perform zero-shot original?original translation. Because most MT training sets do not annotate each sentence pair's original language, we train a binary classifier to predict whether the target side of a pair is original text in that language or translated from the source language. This follows several prior works attempting to identify translations  (Kurokawa et al., 2009; Koppel and Ordan, 2011; Lembersky et al., 2012) . To train the classifier, we need target-language text annotated by whether it is original or translated. We use News Crawl data from WMT 2 as targetoriginal data. It consists of news articles crawled from the internet, so we assume that most of them are not translations. Getting translated data is trickier; most human-translated pairs where the original language is annotated are only present in test sets, which are generally small. To sidestep this, we choose to use machine translation as a proxy for human translationese, based on the assumption that they are similar. This allows us to create classifier training data using only unannotated monolingual data. We propose two ways of doing this: using forward translation (FT) or round-trip translation (RTT). Both are illustrated in Figure  2 . To generate FT data, we take source-language News Crawl data and translate it into the target language using a machine translation model trained on WMT training bitext. We can then train a classifier to distinguish the generated text from monolingual target-language text. One potential problem with the FT data set is that the original and translated pairs may differ not only in the respects we care about (i.e. translationese), but also in content. Taking English?French as an example language pair, one could imagine that certain topics are more commonly reported on in original English language news than in French, and vice versa, e.g. news about American or French politics, respectively. The words and phrases representing those topics could then act as signals to the classifier to distinguish the original language. To address this, we also experiment with RTT data. For this approach we take target-language monolingual data and round-trip translate it with two machine translation models (target?source and then source?target), resulting in another target-language sentence that should contain the same content as the original sentence, alleviating the concern with FT data. Here we hope that the noise introduced by round-trip translation will be similar enough to human translationese to be useful for our downstream task. In both settings, we use the trained binary classifier to detect and tag training bitext pairs where the classifier predicted that the target side is original. 3 Experimental Set-up 

 Data We perform our experiments on WMT18 English?German bitext and WMT15 English?French bitext. We use WMT News Crawl for monolingual data  (2007 for German and 2007 -2014 . We filter out sentences longer than 250 subwords (see Section 3.2 for the vocabulary used) and remove pairs whose length ratio is greater than 2. This results in about 5M pairs for English?German. We do not filter the English?French bitext, resulting in 41M sentence pairs. For monolingual data, we deduplicate and filter sentences with more than 70 tokens or 500 characters. For the experiments described later in Section 5.3, this monolingual data is back-translated with a target-to-source translation model; after doing so, we remove any sentence pairs where the back-translated source is longer than 75 tokens or 550 characters. This results in 216.5M sentences for English?German (of which we only use 24M at a time) and 39M for English?French. As a final step, we use an in-house language identification tool based on the publicly-available Compact Language Detector 2 3 to remove all pairs with the incorrect source or target language. This was motivated by observing that some training pairs had the incorrect language on one side, including cases where both sides were the same;  Khayrallah and Koehn (2018)  found that this type of noise is especially harmful to neural models. The classifiers were trained on the target language monolingual data in addition to either an equal amount of source language monolingual data machine-translated into the target language (for the FT classifiers) or the same target sentences roundtrip translated through the source language with MT (for the RTT classifiers). In both cases, the MT models were trained only with WMT bitext. The models used to generate the synthetic data have BLEU  (Papineni et al., 2002)  performance as follows on newstest2014/full: German?English 31.8; English?German 28.5; French?English 39.2; English?French 40.6. Here and elsewhere, we report BLEU scores with SacreBLEU  (Post, 2018) ; see Section 3.3. Both language pairs considered in this work are high-resource. While translationese is a potential concern for all language pairs, in low-resource settings it is overshadowed by general quality concerns stemming from the lack of training data. We leave for future work the application of these techniques to low-resource language pairs. 

 Architecture and Training Our NMT models use the transformer-big architecture  (Vaswani et al., 2017)  implemented in lingvo  (Shen et al., 2019)  with a shared sourcetarget byte-pair-encoding (BPE) vocabulary  (Sennrich et al., 2016b)  of 32k types. To stabilize training, we use exponentially weighted moving average (EMA) decay  (Buduma and Locascio, 2017)  Checkpoints were picked by best dev BLEU on a set consisting of a tagged and untagged version of every input. For the translationese classifier, we trained a three-layer CNN-based classifier optimized with Adagrad. We picked checkpoints by F1 on the development set, which was newstest2015 for English?German and a subset of newstest2013 containing 500 English-original and 500 Frenchoriginal sentence pairs for English?French. We found that the choice of architecture (RNN/CNN) and hyperparameters did not make a substantial difference in classifier accuracy. 

 Evaluation We report BLEU  (Papineni et al., 2002)  scores with SacreBLEU  (Post, 2018)  and include the identification string 4 to facilitate comparison with future work. We also run human evaluations for the best performing systems (Section 4.3). 

 Results and Discussion 

 Classifier Accuracy Before evaluating the usefulness of our translationese classifiers for the downstream task of machine translation, we can first evaluate how accurate they are at distinguishing original text from human translations. We use WMT test sets for this evaluation, because they consist of source-original and target-original sentence pairs in equal number. For French, the FT classifier scored 0.81 F1 and the RTT classifier scored 0.68 on newstest2014/full. For German, the FT classifier achieved 0.85 F1 and the RTT classifier scored 0.65 on newstest2015. We note that while the FT classifiers perform reasonably well, the RTT classifiers are less effective. This result is in line with prior work by   Kurokawa et al. (2009) , who trained an SVM classifier on French sentences to detect translations from English. They used word n-gram features for their classifier and achieved 0.77 F1, but were worried about a potential content effect and so also trained a classifier where nouns and verbs were replaced with corresponding part-of-speech (POS) tags, achieving 0.69 F1. Note that they tested on the Canadian Hansard corpus (containing Canadian parliamentary transcripts in English and French) while we tested on WMT test sets, so the numbers are not directly comparable, but it is interesting to see the similar trends in comparing content-aware and content-unaware versions of the same method. We also point out that  Kurokawa et al. (2009)  both trained and tested with humantranslated sentences, while we trained our classifiers with machine-translated sentences while still testing on human-translated data. The portion of our data classified as targetoriginal by each classifier is reported in Table  1 .  (RTT) classifier performs slightly worse than the baseline. However, the model trained with data tagged by the forward translation (FT) classifier is able to achieve an improvement of 0.5 BLEU on both halves of the test set when biased toward translationese on the source-original half and original text on the target-original half. This, coupled with the observation that the BLEU score on the source-original half sharply drops when adding the tag, indicates that the two halves of the test set represent quite different tasks, and that the model has learned to associate the tag with some aspects specific to generating original text as opposed to translationese. However, we were not able to replicate this positive result on the English?German language pair (Table  2b ). Interestingly, in this scenario the relative ordering of the FT and RTT models is reversed, with the German RTT-trained model outperforming the FT-trained one. This is also interesting because the German FT classifier achieved a higher F1 score than the French one, indicating that a classifier's performance alone is not a sufficient indicator of its effect on translation performance. One possible explanation for the negative result is that the English?German bitext only contains 5M pairs, as opposed to the 41M for English?French, so splitting the data into two portions could make it difficult to learn both portions' output distributions properly. 

 NMT with Translationese-Classified Bitext 

 Human Evaluation Experiments In the previous subsection, we saw that BLEU for the source-original half of the test set went down when the model trained with FT classifications (FT clf.) was decoded it as if it were target-original (Table 2a). Prior work has shown that BLEU has a low correlation with human judgments when the reference contains translationese but the system output is biased toward original/natural text  (Freitag et al., 2019) . This is the very situation we find ourselves in now. Consequently, we run a human evaluation to see if the output truly is more natu-ral and thereby preferred by human raters, despite the loss in BLEU. We run both a fluency and an adequacy evaluation for English?French to compare the quality of this system when decoding as if source-original vs. target-original. We also compare the system with the Untagged baseline. All evaluations are conducted with bilingual speakers whose native language is French, and each is rated by 3 different raters, with the average taken as the final score. Our two evaluations are as follows: ? Adequacy: Raters were shown only the source sentence and the model output. Each output was scored on a 6-point scale. ? Fluency: Raters saw two target sentences (two models' outputs) without the source sentence, and were asked to select which was more fluent, or whether they were equally good. Fluency human evaluation results are shown in Table  3 . We measured inter-rater agreement using Fleiss' Kappa  (Fleiss, 1971) , which attains a maximum value of 1 when raters always agree. This value was 0.24 for the comparison with the untagged baseline, and 0.16 for the comparison with the translationese decodes. The agreement levels are fairly low, indicating a large amount of subjectivity for this task. However, raters on average still indicated a preference for the FT clf. model's natural decodes. This provides evidence that they are more fluent than both the translationese decodes from the same model and the baseline untagged model, despite the drop in BLEU compared to each. Adequacy human ratings are summarised in Table 4. Both decodes from the FT clf. model scored significantly better than the baseline. This is especially true of the natural decodes, demonstrating that the model does not suffer a loss in adequacy by generating more fluent output, and actually sees a significant gain. We hypothesize that splitting the data as we did here allowed the model to learn a sharper distribution for both portions, thereby increasing the quality of both decode types. Some additional evidence for this is the fact that the FT clf. model's training loss was consistently lower than that of the baseline. 5 Supplemental Experiments 

 Measuring Translationese Translationese tends to be simpler, more standardised and more explicit  (Baker et al., 1993)  compared to original text and can retain typical characteristics of the source language  (Toury, 2012) .  Toral (2019)  proposed metrics attempting to quantify the degree of translationese present in a translation. Following their work, we quantify lexical simplicity with two metrics: lexical variety and lexical density. We also calculate the length variety between the source sentence and the generated translations to measure interference from the source. 

 Lexical Variety An output is simpler when it uses a lower number of unique tokens/words. By generating output closer to original target text, our hope is to increase lexical variety. Lexical variety is calculated as the typetoken ratio (TTR): T T R = number of types number of tokens (1)  (2006)  found that translationese tends to be lexically simpler and have a lower percentage of content words (adverbs, adjectives, nouns and verbs) than original written text. Lexical density is calculated as follows: 

 Lexical Density 

 Scarpa lex density = number of content words number of total words (2) 

 Length Variety Both MT and humans tend to avoid restructuring the source sentence and stick to sentence structures popular in the source language. This results in a translation with similar length to that of the source sentence. By measuring the length variety, we measure interference in the translation because its length is guided by the source sentence's structure. We compute the normalized absolute length difference at the sentence level and average the scores over the test set of source-target pairs (x, y): length variety = ||x| ? |y|| |x| (3) 

 Results Results for all three different translationese measurements are shown in Table  5 . Lexical Variety : Using the tag to decode as natural text (i.e. more like original target text) increases lexical variety. This is expected as original sentences tend to use a larger vocabulary. Lexical Density : We also increase lexical density when decoding as natural text. In other words, the model has a higher percentage of content words in its output, which is an indication that it is more like original target-language text. Length Variety : Unlike the previous two metrics, decoding as natural text does not lead to a more "natural" (i.e. larger) average length variety. One reason may be related to the fact that this is the only metric that also depends on the source sentence: since all of our training pairs feature translationese on either the source or target side, both the tagged and untagged training pairs will feature similar sentence structures, so the model never fully learns to produce different structures. This further illustrates the problem of the lack of original?original training data noted in the introduction. 

 Tagging using Translationese Heuristics Rather than tagging training data with a trained classifier, as explored in the previous sections, it might be possible to tag using much simpler heuristics, and achieve a similar effect. We explore two options here. 

 Length Ratio Tagging Here, we partition the training pairs (x, y) according to a simple length ratio |x| |y| . We use a threshold ?length empirically calculated from two large monolingual corpora, M x and M y : ?length = 1 |Mx| x i ?Mx |x i | 1 |My| y i ?My |y i | (4) For English?French, we found ?length = 0.8643, meaning that original French sentences tend to have more tokens than English. We tag all pairs with length ratio greater than ?length (49.8% of the training bitext). Based on the discussion in Section 5.1.3, we expect that |x| |y| ? 1.0 indicates translationese, so in this case the tag should mean "produce translationese" instead of "produce original text." 

 Lexical Density Tagging We tag examples with a target-side lexical density of greater than 0.5, which means that the target is more likely to be original than translationese. Please refer to Section 5.1.2 for an explanation of this metric. 

 Results Table  6  shows the results for this experiment, compared to the untagged baseline and the classifiertagged model from Table  2a . This table specifically looks at the effect of controlling whether the output should feature more or less translationese on each subset of the test set. We see that the lexical density tagging approach yields expected results, in that the tag can be used to effectively increase BLEU on the target-original portion of the test set. The length-ratio tagging, however, has the opposite effect: producing shorter outputs ("decode as if translationese") produces higher target-original BLEU and lower source-original BLEU. We speculate that this data partition has accidentally picked up on some artifact of the data. Two interesting observations from Table  6  are that 1) both heuristic tagging methods perform much more poorly than the classifier tagging method on both test set halves, and 2) all varieties of tagging produce large performance changes (up to -7.2 BLEU). This second observation highlights that tagging can be powerful -and dangerous when it does not correspond well with the desired feature. 

 Back-Translation Experiments We also investigated whether using a classifier to tag training data improved model performance in the presence of back-translated (BT) data.  introduced tagged back-translation (TBT), where all back-translated pairs are tagged and no bitext pairs are. They experimented with decoding the model with a tag ("as-if-backtranslated") but found it harmed BLEU score. However, in our early experiments we discovered that doing this actually improved the model's performance on the target-original portion of the test set, while harming it on the source-original half. Thus, we frame TBT as a heuristic method for identifying target-original pairs: the monolingual data used for the back-translations is assumed to be original, and the target side of the bitext is assumed to be translated. We wish to know whether we can find a better tagging scheme for the combined BT+bitext data, based on a classifier or some other heuristic. Results for English?French models trained with BT data are presented in Table  7a . While combining the bitext classified by the FT classifier with all-tagged BT data yields a minor gain of 0.2 BLEU over the TBT baseline of , the other methods do not beat the baseline. This indicates that assuming all of the target monolingual data to be original is not as harmful as the error introduced by the classifiers. English?German results are presented in Table 7b. Combining the bitext classified by the RTT classifier with all-tagged BT data matched the performance of the TBT baseline, but none of the models outperformed it. This is expected, given the poor performance of the bitext-only models for this language pair.  

 Example Output In Table  8 , we show example outputs for WMT English?French comparing the Untagged baseline with the FT clf. natural decodes. In the first example, avec suffisamment d'art is an incorrect word-for-word translation, as the French word art cannot be used in that context. Here the word habilement, which is close to "skilfully" in English, sounds more natural. In the second example, libre d'imp?t is the literal translation of "tax-free", but French documents rarely use it, they prefer pas imposable, meaning "not taxable". 7 Related Work 

 Translationese The effects of translationese on MT training and evaluation have been investigated by many prior authors  (Kurokawa et al., 2009; Lembersky et al., 2012; Toral et al., 2018; Zhang and Toral, 2019; Graham et al., 2019; Freitag et al., 2019; Edunov et al., 2019; Freitag et al., 2020) . Training classifiers to detect translationese has also been done  (Kurokawa et al., 2009; Koppel and Ordan, 2011) . Similarly to this work,  Kurokawa et al. (2009)  used their classifier to preprocess MT training data; however, they completely removed target-original pairs. In contrast,  Lembersky et al. (2012)  used both types of data (without explicitly distinguishing them with a classifier), and used entropy-based measures to cause their phrase-based system to favor phrase table entries with target phrases that are more similar to a corpus of translationese than original text. In this work, we combine aspects from each of these: we train a classifier to partition the training data, and use both subsets to train a single model with a mechanism allowing control over the degree of translationese to produce in the output. We also show with human evaluations that source-original test sentence pairs result in BLEU scores that do not correlate well with translation quality when evaluating models trained to produce more original output. 

 Training Data Tagging for NMT In addition to the methods in , tagging training data and using the tags to control output is a technique that has been growing in popularity. Tags on the source sentence have Source Sorry she didn't phrase it artfully enough for you. Untagged D?sol?e, elle ne l'a pas formul? avec suffisamment d'art pour vous. FT clf. D?sol? elle ne l'a pas formul? assez habilement pour vous. Source Your first 10,000 is tax free. Untagged Votre premi?re tranche de 10 000 est libre d'imp?t. FT clf. La premi?re tranche de 10 000 n'est pas imposable. been used to indicate target language in multilingual models  (Johnson et al., 2016) , formality level in English?Japanese  (Yamagishi et al., 2016) , politeness in English?German  (Sennrich et al., 2016a) , gender from a gender-neutral language  (Kuczmarski and Johnson, 2018) , as well as to produce domain-targeted translation  (Kobus et al., 2016) .  Shu et al. (2019)  use tags at training and inference time to increase the syntactic diversity of their output while maintaining translation quality; similarly,  Agarwal and Carpuat (2019)  and  Marchisio et al. (2019)  use tags to control the reading level (e.g. simplicity/complexity) of the output. Overall, tagging can be seen as domain adaptation  (Freitag and Al-Onaizan, 2016; Luong and Manning, 2015) . 

 Conclusion We have demonstrated that translationese and original text can be treated as separate target languages in a "multilingual" model, distinguished by a classifier trained using only monolingual and synthetic data. The resulting model has improved performance in the ideal, zero-shot scenario of original?original translation, as measured by human evaluation of adequacy and fluency. However, this is associated with a drop in BLEU score, indicating that better automatic evaluation is needed.
