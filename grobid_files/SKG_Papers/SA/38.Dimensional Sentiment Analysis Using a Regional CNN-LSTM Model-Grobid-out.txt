Dimensional Sentiment Analysis Using a Regional CNN-LSTM Model

abstract
Dimensional sentiment analysis aims to recognize continuous numerical values in multiple dimensions such as the valencearousal (VA) space. Compared to the categorical approach that focuses on sentiment classification such as binary classification (i.e., positive and negative), the dimensional approach can provide more fine-grained sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts: regional CNN and LSTM to predict the VA ratings of texts. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses an individual sentence as a region, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in each region can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction. Such regional information is sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and long-distance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction process. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms lexicon-based, regression-based, and NN-based methods proposed in previous studies.

Introduction Sentiment analysis has been useful in the development of online applications for customer reviews and public opinion analysis  (Pang and Lee 2008; Calvo and D'Mello 2010; Liu 2012; Feldman 2013) . In sentiment representation, the cate-gorical approach represents emotional states as several discrete classes such as binary (i.e., positive and negative) or as multiple categories such as  Ekman's (1992)  six basic emotions (anger, happiness, fear, sadness, disgust, and surprise). Classification algorithms can then be used to identify sentiment categories from texts. The dimensional approach represents emotional states as continuous numerical values in multiple dimensions such as the valence-arousal (VA) space  (Russell, 1980) . The dimension of valence refers to the degree of positive and negative sentiment, whereas the dimension of arousal refers to the degree of calm and excitement. Both dimensions range from 1 (highly negative or calm) to 9 (highly positive or excited) based on the self-assessment manikin (SAM) annotation scheme  (Bradley et al. 1994) . For example, the following passage consisting of three sentences is associated with a valence-arousal rating of (2.5, 7.8), which displays a high degree of negativity and arousal. Such high-arousal negative (or high-arousal positive) texts are usually of interest and could prioritized in product review systems. Dimensional sentiment analysis can accomplish this by recognizing the VA ratings of texts and rank them accordingly, thus providing more intelligent and fine-grained sentiment applications. Research on dimensional sentiment analysis has addressed VA recognition at both the wordlevel  (Wei et al., 2011; Malandrakis et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2015)  and the sentence-level  (Paltoglou et al., 2013; Malandrakis et al., 2013) . At the word-level,  Wei et al. (2011)  used linear regression to transfer VA ratings from English affective words to Chinese words.  Malandrakis et al. (2011)  used a kernel function to combine the similarity between words for VA prediction.  Yu et al. (2015)  used a weighted graph model to iteratively determine the VA ratings of affective words. At the sentence level,  Paltoglou et al. (2013)  adopted a lexicon-based method to calculate the VA ratings of texts by averaging the VA ratings of affective words in the texts using a weighted arithmetic/geometric mean.  Malandrakis et al. (2013)  proposed a regression method that extracted n-gram with affective ratings as features to predict VA values for texts. Recently, word embedding  (Mikolov et al., 2013a; Mikolov et al., 2013b)  and deep neural networks (NN) such as convolutional neural networks (CNN)  (Kim, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014) , recurrent neural networks (RNN)  (Graves, 2012; Irsoy and Cardie, 2014)  and long shortterm memory (LSTM)  have been successfully employed for categorical sentiment analysis. In general, CNN is capable of extracting local information but may fail to capture long-distance dependency. LSTM can address this limitation by sequentially modeling texts across sentences. Such NN-based and word embedding methods have not been well explored for dimensional sentiment analysis. This study proposes a regional CNN-LSTM model consisting of two parts, regional CNN and LSTM, to predict the VA ratings of texts. We first construct word vectors for vocabulary words using word embedding. The regional CNN is then used to build text vectors for the given texts being predicted based on the word vectors. Unlike a conventional CNN which considers a whole text as input, the proposed regional CNN uses individual sentences as regions, dividing an input text into several regions such that the useful affective information in different regions can be extracted and weighted according to their contribution to the VA prediction. For example, in the aforementioned example text, it would be useful for the system to emphasize the two sentences/regions (r2) and (r3) containing negative affective information. Finally, such regional information is sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM for VA prediction. By combining the regional CNN and LSTM, both local (regional) information within sentences and longdistance dependency across sentences can be considered in the prediction process. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the proposed regional CNN-LSTM model. Section 3 reports the evaluation results of the proposed method against lexiconbased, regression-based, and NN-based methods. Conclusions are finally drawn in Section 4. 

 Regional CNN-LSTM Model Figure  1  shows the overall framework of the proposed regional CNN-LSTM model. First, the word vectors of vocabulary words are trained from a large corpus using the word2vec toolkit. For each given text, the regional CNN model uses a sentence as a region to divide the given text into R regions, i.e. r1,?, ri, rj, rk,?, rR. In each region, useful affective features can be extracted once the word vectors sequentially pass through a convolutional layer and max pooling layer. Such local (regional) features are then sequentially integrated across regions using LSTM to build a text vector for VA prediction. 

 Convolutional Layer In each region, a convolutional layer is first used to extract local n-gram features. All word embeddings are stacked in a region matrix d V M ? ? ? , where |V| is the vocabulary size of a region, and d is the dimensionality of word vectors. For example, in Fig.  1   l l l n n n y f W b ? + ? = + x ? (1) where ? is a convolutional operator, Given varying text lengths in the regions, y l may have different dimensions for different texts. Therefore, we define the maximum length of the CNN input in the corpora as the dimension N. If the input length is shorter than N, then several random vectors with a uniform distribution U(-0.25, 0.25) will be appended. 

 Max-pooling Layer Max-pooling subsamples the output of the convolutional layer. The most common way to do pooling it to apply a max operation to the result of each filter. There are two reasons to use a max-pooling layer here. First, by eliminating non-maximal values, it reduces computation for upper layers. Second, it can extract the local dependency within different regions to keep the most salient information. The obtained region vectors are then fed to a sequential layer. 

 Sequential Layer To capture long-distance dependency across regions, the sequential layer sequentially integrates each region vector into a text vector. Due to the problem of gradients vanishing or exploding in RNN  (Bengio et al., 1994) , LSTM is introduced in the sequential layer for vector composition. After the LSTM memory cell sequentially traverses through all regions, the last hidden state of the sequential layer is regarded as the text representation for VA prediction. 

 Linear Decoder Since the values in both the valence and arousal dimensions are continuous, the VA prediction task requires a regression. Instead of using a softmax classifier, a linear activation function (also known as a linear decoder) is used in the output layer, defined as, d t d y W b = + x (2) where xt is the text vector learned from the sequential layer, y is the degree of valence or arousal of the target text, and Wd and bd respectively denote the weight and bias associated with the linear decoder. The regional CNN-LSTM model is trained by minimizing the mean squared error between the predicted y and actual y. Given a training set of text matrix X={x  (1)  , x  (2)  ,?, x (m) }, and their VA ratings set y={y  (1)  , y  (2)  , ?, y (m) }, the loss function is defined as 2 ( ) ( ) 1 1 ( , ) ( ) 2 m i i i L h y m = = ? ? X y x (3) In the training phase, a back propagation (BP) algorithm with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is used to learn model parameters. Details of the BP algorithm can be found in  (LeCun et al., 2012) . 

 Experiments This section evaluates the performance of the proposed regional CNN-LSTM model against lexicon-based, regression-based, and NN-based methods. Datasets. This experiment used two affective corpora. i) Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST)  (Socher et al., 2013)  contains 8,544 training texts, 2,210 test texts, and 1,101 validation texts. Each text was rated with a single dimension (valence) in the range of (0, 1). ii) Chinese Valence-Arousal Texts (CVAT)  (Yu et al., 2016)  consists of 2,009 texts collected from social forums, manually rated with both valence and arousal dimensions in the range of (1, 9) using the SAM annotation scheme  (Bradley et al. 1994) . The word vectors for English and Chinese were respectively trained using the Google News and Chinese wiki dumps (zhwiki) datasets. The dimensionality for both word vectors are 300. Experimental Settings. Two lexicon-based methods were used for comparison: weighted arithmetic mean (wAM) and weighted geometric mean (wGM)  (Paltoglou et al., 2013) , along with two regression-based methods: average values regression (AVR) and maximum values regression (MVR)  (Malandrakis et al., 2013) . The valence ratings of English and Chinese words were respectively taken from the Extended ANEW  (Warriner et al., 2013)  and Chinese Valence-Arousal Words (CVAW) lexicons  (Yu et al., 2016) . A conventional CNN, RNN and LSTM were also implemented for comparison. Metrics. Performance was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r), defined as ? Root mean square error (RMSE) ( ) 2 1 n i i i RMSE A P n = = ? ? (4) ? Mean absolute error (MAE) 1 1 | | n i i i MAE A P n = = ? ? (5) ? Pearson correlation coefficient (r) 1 1 ( )( ) 1 n i i i A P A A P P r n ? ? = ? ? = ? ? (6) where Ai is the actual value, Pi is the predicted value, n is the number of test samples, A and P respectively denote the arithmetic mean of A and P, and ? is the standard deviation. A lower RMSE or MAE and a higher r value indicates better prediction performance. A t-test was used to determine whether the performance difference was statistically significant.   Comparative Results. Tables  1 and 2  respectively present the comparative results of the regional CNN-LSTM against several methods for VA prediction of texts in both English and Chinese corpora. For the lexicon-based methods, wGM outperformed wAM, which is consistent with the results presented in  (Paltoglou et al., 2013) . Instead of using the VA ratings of words to directly measure those of texts, the regressionbased methods learned the correlations between the VA ratings of words and texts, thus yielding better performance. Once the word embedding and deep learning techniques were introduced, the performance of NN-based methods (except RNN) jumped dramatically. In addition, the proposed regional CNN-LSTM outperformed the other NN-based methods, indicating the effectiveness of sequentially integrating the regional information across regions. Another observation is that the Pearson correlation coefficient of prediction in arousal is lower than that for the valence prediction, indicating that arousal is more difficult to predict.

 Conclusion This study presents a regional CNN-LSTM model to predict the VA ratings of texts. By capturing both local (regional) information within sentences and long-distance dependency across sentences, the proposed method outperformed regression-and conventional NN-based methods presented in previous studies. Future work will focus on the use of a parser to identify regions so the structural information can be further incorporated to improve the prediction performance.
