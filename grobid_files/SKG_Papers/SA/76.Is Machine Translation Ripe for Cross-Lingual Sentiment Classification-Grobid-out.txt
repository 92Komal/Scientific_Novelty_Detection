Is Machine Translation Ripe for Cross-lingual Sentiment Classification?

abstract
Recent advances in Machine Translation (MT) have brought forth a new paradigm for building NLP applications in low-resource scenarios. To build a sentiment classifier for a language with no labeled resources, one can translate labeled data from another language, then train a classifier on the translated text. This can be viewed as a domain adaptation problem, where labeled translations and test data have some mismatch. Various prior work have achieved positive results using this approach. In this opinion piece, we take a step back and make some general statements about crosslingual adaptation problems. First, we claim that domain mismatch is not caused by MT errors, and accuracy degradation will occur even in the case of perfect MT. Second, we argue that the cross-lingual adaptation problem is qualitatively different from other (monolingual) adaptation problems in NLP; thus new adaptation algorithms ought to be considered. This paper will describe a series of carefullydesigned experiments that led us to these conclusions.

Summary Question 1: If MT gave perfect translations (semantically), do we still have a domain adaptation challenge in cross-lingual sentiment classification? Answer: Yes. The reason is that while many translations of a word may be valid, the MT system might have a systematic bias. For example, the word "awesome" might be prevalent in English reviews, but in translated reviews, the word "excellent" is generated instead. From the perspective of MT, this translation is correct and preserves sentiment polarity. But from the perspective of a classifier, there is a domain mismatch due to differences in word distributions. Question 2: Can we apply standard adaptation algorithms developed for other (monolingual) adaptation problems to cross-lingual adaptation? Answer: No. It appears that the interaction between target unlabeled data and source data can be rather unexpected in the case of cross-lingual adaptation. We do not know the reason, but our experiments show that the accuracy of adaptation algorithms in cross-lingual scenarios have much higher variance than monolingual scenarios. The goal of this opinion piece is to argue the need to better understand the characteristics of domain adaptation in cross-lingual problems. We invite the reader to disagree with our conclusion (that the true barrier to good performance is not insufficient MT quality, but inappropriate domain adaptation methods). Here we present a series of experiments that led us to this conclusion. First we describe the experiment design ( ?2) and baselines ( ?3), before answering Question 1 ( ?4) and Question 2 ( ?5). 

 Experiment Design The cross-lingual setup is this: we have labeled data from source domain S and wish to build a sentiment classifier for target domain T . Domain mismatch can arise from language differences (e.g. English vs. translated text) or market differences (e.g. DVD vs. Book reviews). Our experiments will involve fixing T to a common testset and varying S. This allows us to experiment with different settings for adaptation. We use the Amazon review dataset of Prettenhofer (2010) 1 , due to its wide range of languages (English  [EN] , Japanese [JP], French [FR], German  [DE] ) and markets (music, DVD, books). Unlike Prettenhofer (2010), we reverse the direction of cross-lingual adaptation and consider English as target. English is not a low-resource language, but this setting allows for more comparisons. Each source dataset has 2000 reviews, equally balanced between positive and negative. The target has 2000 test samples, large unlabeled data (25k, 30k, 50k samples respectively for Music, DVD, and Books), and an additional 2000 labeled data reserved for oracle experiments. Texts in JP, FR, and DE are translated word-by-word into English with Google Translate.  2  We perform three sets of experiments, shown in Table  1 . Table 2 lists all the results; we will interpret them in the following sections.   

 How much performance degradation occurs in cross-lingual adaptation? First, we need to quantify the accuracy degradation under different source data, without consideration of domain adaptation methods. So we train a SVM classifier on labeled source data 3 , and directly apply it on test data. The oracle setting, which has no domain-mismatch (e.g. train on Music-EN, test on Music-EN), achieves an average test accuracy of (81.6 + 80.9 + 80.0)/3 = 80.8% 4 . Aver-age cross-lingual accuracies are: 69.4% (JP), 75.6% (FR), 77.0% (DE), so degradations compared to oracle are: -11% (JP), -5% (FR), -4% (DE). 5 Crossmarket degradations are around -6% 6 . Observation 1: Degradations due to market and language mismatch are comparable in several cases (e.g. MUSIC-DE and DVD-EN perform similarly for target MUSIC-EN). Observation 2: The ranking of source language by decreasing accuracy is DE > FR > JP. Does this mean JP-EN is a more difficult language pair for MT? The next section will show that this is not necessarily the case. Certainly, the domain mismatch for JP is larger than DE, but this could be due to phenomenon other than MT errors. 4 Where exactly is the domain mismatch? 

 Theory of Domain Adaptation We analyze domain adaptation by the concepts of labeling and instance mismatch  (Jiang and Zhai, 2007) . Let p t (x, y) = p t (y|x)p t (x) be the target distribution of samples x (e.g. unigram feature vector) and labels y (positive / negative). Let p s (x, y) = p s (y|x)p s (x) be the corresponding source distribution. We assume that one (or both) of the following distributions differ between source and target: ? Instance mismatch: p s (x) = p t (x). ? Labeling mismatch: p s (y|x) = p t (y|x). Instance mismatch implies that the input feature vectors have different distribution (e.g. one dataset uses the word "excellent" often, while the other uses the word "awesome"). This degrades performance because classifiers trained on "excellent" might not know how to classify texts with the word "awesome." The solution is to tie together these features  (Blitzer et al., 2006)  or re-weight the input distribution  (Sugiyama et al., 2008) . Under some assumptions (i.e. covariate shift), oracle accuracy can be achieved theoretically  (Shimodaira, 2000) . Labeling mismatch implies the same input has different labels in different domains. For example, the JP word meaning "excellent" may be mistranslated as "bad" in English. Then, positive JP reviews will be associated with the word "bad": p s (y = +1|x = bad) will be high, whereas the true conditional distribution should have high p t (y = ?1|x = bad) instead. There are several cases for labeling mismatch, depending on how the polarity changes (Table  3 ). The solution is to filter out these noisy samples  (Jiang and Zhai, 2007)  or optimize loosely-linked objectives through shared parameters or Bayesian priors  (Finkel and Manning, 2009) . Which mismatch is responsible for accuracy degradations in cross-lingual adaptation? ? Instance mismatch: Systematic MT bias generates word distributions different from naturallyoccurring English. (Translation may be valid.) ? Label mismatch: MT error mis-translates a word into something with different polarity. 

 Conclusion from ?4 .2 and ?4.3: Instance mismatch occurs often; MT error appears minimal.
