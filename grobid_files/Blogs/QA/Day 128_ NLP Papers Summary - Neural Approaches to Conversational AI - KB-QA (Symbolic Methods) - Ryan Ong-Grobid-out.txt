By Ryan 7th May 2020 No Comments Day 128: NLP Papers Summary -Neural Approaches To Conversational AI -KB-QA (Symbolic Methods) Conversational QA system has become very popular in recent years and many techniques have been explored to build a good reliable QA system. Most QA systems allow users to either query from a knowledge base (KB-QA) or from a collection of documents (text-QA). We will rst review the KB-QA space, both symbolic and neural methods and then the text-QA space. In terms of KB-QA space, we will go over the symbolic methods in this blog post and then the neural methods in tomorrow's post. We will rst review symbolic approaches in KB-QA and showcase some of its limitations including scalability. We will then review different neural methods that have been proposed to address these issues. We will also be discussing multiturn and conversational KB-QA agents which are not as well-studied. 

 What is a Knowledge Base? A standard KB is a structured database that stores all the different entities and relationships in the form of subject-predicate-object triplets (s, r, t). In this case, s and t are the entities and r is the relation between the two entities. KB can be represented in the form of a knowledge graph as shown below, where entities are the nodes and relations are the directed edges. Semantic Parsing for KB-QA  ?

 Figure Figure above (on the right) showcase semantic parsing for KB-QA, which it's the core of many symbolic methods SOTA KB-QA systems. Questions are mapped to its formal meaning representations (logic form) and its equivalent graph representation (query graph), before it's feed into the KB. Reasoning will then happen within the KB through nding a sequence of paths hat match the query and retrieve the end nodes.
