abstract


Experiments and Results There are two experiment settings as we have two different datasets here.  which 3862 contain a single target and the remainder multiple targets Each sentence contains a list of target-aspect pairs with the sentiment polarity Given a sentence and the target, we need to Detect mention of an aspect for the target Determine polarity for the detected target-aspect pairs SEMEVAL-2014 TASK 4 This is ABSA and not TABSA and so they don't have target-aspect pairs, just aspect. Allows the model to tackle subtask 3 (Aspect Detection) and subtask 4 (Aspect Polarity) at the same time. Methodology The paper uses 4 methods to construct auxiliary sentences to convert TABSA to a sentence pair classi cation task. Using (LOCATION1, safety) as a target-aspect pair: Sentences for QA-M ? ? 21/02/2022, 22:03 Day 103: NLP Papers Summary -Utilizing BERT for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis via Constructing Auxil? https://ryanong.co.uk/2020/04/12/day-103-nlp-research-papers-utilizing-bert-for-aspect-based-sentiment-analysis-via-constructi? 3/9The sentence we want to generate from target-aspect pair is a question and the format needs to be the same "What do you think of the safety of location -1 ?"Sentences for NLI-MThe sentence created there is not a standard sentence but a simple pseudoand converted TABSA into a binary classi cation problem of yes or no to obtain the probability distribution Each target-aspect pair will generate three sequences such as: "the polarity of the aspect safety of location -1 is positive" "the polarity of the aspect safety of location -1 is negative" "the polarity of the aspect safety of location -1 is none"We use the probability value of yes as the matching score and take the class of sequence with the highest matching score for the predicted

The following are the chosen models for comparisons: outperformed Dmu-Entnet in aspect detection but scored a lower accuracy in sentiment classi cation accuracy ?
