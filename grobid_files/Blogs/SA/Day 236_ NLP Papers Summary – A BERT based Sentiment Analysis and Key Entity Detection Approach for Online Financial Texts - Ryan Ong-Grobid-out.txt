Day 236: NLP Papers Summary -A BERT Based Sentiment Analysis And Key Entity Detection Approach For Online Financial Texts

abstract
Objectives and Contributions Used BERT to perform sentiment analysis and key entity detection on nancial texts. We consider key entity detection as a sentence matching task. We proposed an ensemble learning that outperformed SVM, LR, NBM, and BERT for two nancial sentiment analysis and key entity detection datasets.

We combine sentiment analysis and key entity detection in a uni ed approach based on RoBERTa. We ne-tuned RoBERTa using different methods to implement sentiment analysis and key entity detection. With sentiment analysis, we focus speci cally on the negative emotion information. With key entity detection, we were able to match each nancial entity with its text to detect the key entities of negative information. In terms of step 3, in certain ne-grained tasks, we are required to select the most relevant key entities based on the tags of the nancial text. Tags can be corruption, fraud etc. This is more of a machine reading comprehension (MRC) task and therefore, we treat each nancial text as an MRC article and rewrite its tag as MRC questions. The answers predicted by the MRC model are considered to be key entities.  

 Methodology 

 Experiments and Results 

 DATASET Existing entity detection methods cannot detect key entities, let alone selecting the most relevant entities with tags. Therefore, we propose RoBERTa based sentiment analysis and key entity detection approach for online nancial texts as follows: 1. Analyse the sentiment of text using RoBERTa (classic) 2. Get nancial entity list and select key entities 3. Select the key entity with tags In terms of step 2, for each piece of nancial data, we use NER to get a list of entities. In the coarse-grained task, we detected some key entities related to the nancial text from the entity list. As shown in the gure below, we feed each entity and the nancial text into RoBERTa and use RoBERTa as a sentence matching model to determine whether each entity is a key entity. The number of models is determined by the number of entities. We would form a list of key entities of those entities that are predicted as key by RoBERTa. ? ? 21/02/2022, 22:03 Day 236: NLP Papers Summary -A BERT based Sentiment Analysis and Key Entity Detection Approach for ? https://ryanong.co.uk/2020/08/23/day-236-nlp-papers-summary-a-bert-based-sentiment-analysis-and-key-entity-detection-appr? 3/7 

 We used two datasets: Negative Financial Information and Subject Deter-mination 2019 and Event Subject Extraction for Financial Field. The table below showcase the descriptive statistics of the dataset. Our evaluation metrics are accuracy rate for sentiment analysis and F1 score for key entity detection.
