abstract


The idea behind the proposed framework is simple, they suggest that decoupling language models and the functions with which the token. Sentence Permutation random shuffling of the document's sentences. Document Rotation a token is chosen randomly to be the start of the document, the section before the starting token is appended at the end. Masked Seq2Seq (MASS) masking a span containing 50% of the tokens and train to predict the masked tokens. 

 Results of the first experiment Figure 3: Table of results for the first experiment From the results of these first experiments, the authors draw some important conclusions. 

 Token masking is crucial Only the configurations with token masking or its variations achieve consistently great performance on different tasks. 

 Left-to-right pre-training improves NLG The Classical Language Model objective despite not doing well in inference or question answering tasks achieves SOTA on ELI5(Explain Like I'm 5). Bidirectional encoders are crucial for QA Ignoring future context hinders the performance of left-to-right models. While pre-training techniques and LM objectives are important, the authors make note of the fact that they do not provide the full picture. They report that their permuted language model performs much worse than XLNet because BART lacks some of the valuable architectural innovations introduced in XLNet. 

 Results of the large-scale pre-training experiment After the comparative experiment, the authors trained a 12 layered, transformer-based architecture for autoencoding, and using  If you want to summarize some text of your own we have set up a Google Colab notebook using the Hugging Face library.

 similar hyperparameters to RoBERTa. They used both a form of token masking at 30% and sentence permutation as pre-training textnoising techniques and run the model on 160GB of news, books, stories, and web text, similar to what's done in RoBERTa.
