Day 114: NLP Papers Summary -A Summarization System For Scienti c Documents Objective and Contribution

abstract
Proposed IBM Science Summariser for summarising computer science research papers. The system can identify different scenarios such as discovery, exploration, and understanding of scienti c documents. The proposed system summarises research papers in two ways: either in free-text query or by choosing categorised values such as scienti c tasks, datasets, and more. The proposed system ingested 270,000 papers.

The IBM Science Summariser produces summaries that focuses on user's queries (queryfocused summarisation). It summarises various sections of the paper independently, allowing users to focus on relevant sections only. This allows for the interaction between user's queries and various entities in the paper.  

 Human Evaluation EVALUATION SETUP We approached 12 authors and asked them to evaluate summaries of two papers they have co-authored. This gives us a total of 24 papers. For each paper, we produced two types of summaries: section-based summary and section-agnostic summary (treating the paper content as at text). This is for us to assess the bene t of section-bases summarisation. This gives us a total of 48 summaries to be evaluated. The authors are required to perform 3 tasks per summary: 1. For each sentence, determine whether the sentence should be included as part of the summary (binary measure of the precision) 2. How well each sections of the paper is covered in the summary (measure of recall, 1 -5 scale, 3 being good) 3. Evaluate the overall quality of the summary (1 -5 scale, 3 being good) 

 RESULTS The results are shown in the gure below. For task 2, section-based summary scored higher in 68% of the papers. The average score for section-based summaries is 3.32 which highlights the quality of section-based summaries. 

 Conclusion and Future Work As future work, the IBM Science Summariser plan on adding support for more entities and ingest more papers. More qualitative study is being conducted to assess its usage and quality of summaries, including automatic evaluation of summaries. Source: https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D19-3036.pdf ? Figure Figure below showcase the user-interface of the IBM Science Summariser. Users pose their queries (or use the lters on metadata elds). Relevant papers are then returned with summarisation results. Each section is clearly shown with entities accurately highlighted.
